0x14041 0x1403F 0x14089
The "crossbar" in 0x14041 is not depicted like the crossbar in e.g. 0x1403F. Is it that crossbars can look very different?
Or is the glyph of 0x14041 wrong?
<p>
By the way, is a "crossbar" (0x1403F) the same thing as a "crossbeam" (0x14089)? It looks the same. Perhaps the terminology can be made consistent?

0x14042 0x14050
The description of 0x14042 is not nearly as detailed as some others.  For one thing, it doesn't mention the shapes at the ends of the "crescent moon", which are not like other boats, apart from 0x14050 perhaps, which has "prow and stern curved inwards".
<p>
Another thing is that the "back" is at the left, unlike other boats where the back is at the right. 
It would be good to write in descriptions where prow and stern appear reversed.

0x14043 0x14044
Where is the "doorway" in the glyphs?
For 0x14043, the Database refers to:
<p>
http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/4212
<p>
I don't see a doorway there, neither in the transcription nor in the photo.
For 0x14044, the Database refers to p. 46, l. 11 and pl. 32 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara011.pdf
<p>
but that is the wrong sign (0x14045), at least in the transcription and the photo isn't very clear.

0x14045 0x14046
The glyph seems to suggest a doorway not mentioned in the description.
For 0x14045, the Database refers to p. 297, l. 8 and pl. 171, col. 10 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara010.pdf
<p>
Here there is a doorway.
For 0x14046, the Database refers to p. 362, l. 12 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara015.pdf
<p>
which also has a doorway.

0x14048 0x14065 0x14067 0x14069 0x1406A 
The description of 0x14065 mentions a doorway while 0x14048 doesn't. The shape of the shrine looks the same to me though.
<p>
There appear to be *two* oars/rudders in the glyphs while the descriptions have "an oar/rudder" or "a rudder".

0x1404D 0x13933
I don't see a doorway in the glyph of 0x1404D.
Also, in the vague image I seem to make out the vulture headdress underneath the bovine horns headdress, just like 0x13933. Is that real?
<p>
The Database refers to p. 147, l. 2 and pl. CCCCXXXIX of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara005.pdf
<p>
I would interpret the photo as showing a large doorway, but it is uncertain
there is a vulture headdress.
<p>
I think that doorways should not be mentioned in the descriptions of facades,
as they are an overly palaeographic detail irrelevant on the level of Unicode,
especially if a facade is a secondary item in a larger graphical composition,
e.g. a facade on a boat.
The fact that there are so many cases where description and glyph are inconsistent when it comes
to absence/presence of doorways confirms this. If half the time it couldn't be correctly specified 
whether there is or is not a doorway, then 
apparently it doesn't matter that much and it isn't part of the identities of signs anyway.
The same could be said about sun disks on uraei, and about hairstyles for most "men" signs,
ankh signs in certain circumstances (see below), and so on.
A fair amount of pointless work would immediately fall away and make life easier
for sign list developers, for font designers, and last but not least for encoders.
What has been done for Unicode 16 is not sustainable.

0x1405C
I cannot make out the ankh sign. Is it not there, or does it vanish within the image resolution?
<p>
The Database refers to p. 231, l. 12 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara004.pdf
<p>
In the printed transcription, I cannot make out an ankh sign either. This is one of many examples
that suggest that there is a good case for not encoding lower-level details, that is, not
mentioning them in the descriptions and not attempting to clearly display them in the glyphs.
For one thing, this should avoid overinterpretation of photos and normalized transcriptions and hallucinating
things that might not be real.

0x14068 0x1406B 0x1406C
There is "with an oar/rudder at the back" for 0x14068, there is "with lines crossing the prow" for 0x1406C, and nothing comparable for 0x1406B. Yet the shape looks identical in all three glyphs. For consistency, can we just have "with an oar/rudder at the back/front" for all these cases?

0x14067 0x1406E 
Why are these not the same sign? "tall" versus "low" is palaeography, and meaningless on the level of Unicode.
If you ask me as font designer to create glyphs for these two, given the examples in the code charts and the descriptions, 
I will draw two identical shapes.
Both signs are functionally equivalent, representing the Henu-bark of Sokar.

0x14070 0x14075
Missing from the glyph are the "multiple horizontal lines written over it" in the glyph of 0x14070. What was meant is similar to 0x14075.
This is confirmed by the pointer in the Database to pl. 53,A of:
<p>
https://archive.org/details/sethos4/page/52/mode/2up
<p>
Further, the internal lines of the shrine and the lines of the sledge should not have been drawn as one and running over the boat/ship,
and they should be vertical, not diagonal.

0x14074
The shape of the sledge as described ("four vertical lines between two horizontal lines") does not at all correspond to the glyph.
The Database refers to p.  238, l. 5 and pl. 138 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara010.pdf
<p>
This confirms the shape as in the glyph. It seems to me the description needs revision.

0x14076 0x14077
It is hard to imagine a more blatant, more literal violation of Point 5 of the
Encoding Principles:
<p>
"Signs that exist with and without inner detailing will be included with the inner detailing"
<p>
Most of the Encoding Principles use weasel words that allow unlimited proliferation of
variant shapes despite giving the impression of wanting to keep the number of
variant shapes within reasonable bounds. If even one of the clearer Encoding Principles
is so flagrantly broken, then what is the point of having the Encoding Principles in the first place?

0x1407A
The glyph suggests *two* oars/rudders.
<p>
I would not call the mentioned shape in the glyph a "horizontal rectangle". A rectangle consists of straight lines, while the shape is prominently curved. Perhaps say "flat shape inside between prow and stern with vertical lines as internal decoration"?

0x1407C
In the glyph, I don't really see two loops coming from the lower beam of the sail, more like one and half loops. One of the loops ends at the mast, which does not seem quite consistent with the description.
The glyph is consistent with the reference pointed to by the Database, p. 134, l. 4 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Esna007.pdf

0x14084 0x14085
I suspect "point" is a dutchism. The shape at the bottom right I would call a "corner", not a "point".

0x14086
I see no "cross-beam over the sail" in the glyph. I think I see a cross-beam over the mast, *below* the sail. If the cross-beam is over the sail as in the description, what exactly is this supposed to look like?
<p>
In the Database I find comments "For Unicode, I would argue
to only include P5, not any of the many variants (which will be covered in TSL)" and "(P5) will be sufficient for Unicode".
The fact that there are now unresolved issues for 0x14086 and for several other "sail" signs vindicates these comments.
Graphical variants that differ in no more than minute details cause endless inconsistencies and misery for
font designers and encoders alike. I don't understand why this sign was included despite these comments in the Database
arguing against it.

0x14088
Hm, here I don't see a "point" (corner), but rather a short "distinct" beam at the bottom of the sail extending to the right, and a sail between the two "distinct" beams.

0x14089
Correct "point" to "corner".

0x1408B
"filling"? If this is what is meant, I would say something like "without depicting the space between the prongs". Unless "filling" is sailor's jargon for something specific.

0x140F4
I don't think the shapes in the glyph can be described as triangular.  One end is ever so slightly wider than the other end.

0x14109 0x1410A 0x1410B 0x1410C 0x1410D 0x14110
In 0x1410B, 0x1410C, 0x1410D the mentioned things are connected by a line at the bottom. The line is thin in 0x1410C while it is thick and prominent in 0x1410B and 0x1410D. By all reasonable measures, the thickness should not matter as to the character identity. Even if the line is drawn as in 0x1410A, it is still just a line. I doubt there are any good reasons for talking about "base" in 0x14109 and 0x1410A while not even mentioning the connecting line in 0x1410B, 0x1410C, 0x1410D. 
<p>
The description of 0x14110 does mention "base", while the glyph has just a thick line, just like 0x1410B and 0x1410D.
<p>
My proposal would be to have "on a base" (not "a rectangular base") for all such signs for consistency.

0x1410A
The pole is not at the bottom of the block in the glyph.
<p>
This is a typical case where, if we are not to lose our sanity and blow up the sign list by
gazillions more of uninteresting graphical variants, we should make
the description broader. We could allow a pole on top of the block *or* at the bottom of the block,
we could omit mention of the angle of the feather, etc.
That is, we should be moving towards an actual sign list rather than a token list.

0x1412D
In the glyph, there are two dots on either side of the fire-drill. Are those supposed to be there?
