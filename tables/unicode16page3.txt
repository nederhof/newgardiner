0x137E9 0x137EA
The hair in the glyph of 0x137EA will be corrected to "coif" in Unicode 17.

0x137F5 0x137F6 0x137F7
The hair in the glyphs of 0x137F5 and 0x137F6 will be corrected to "coif/short hair" in Unicode 17.

0x13802 0x13803
The hair in the glyph of 0x13803 will be corrected to "long" in Unicode 17.

0x1381A
Unicode 17 will make the glyph consistent with the description by letting the god touch the wall.

0x1382A
The Unicode 17 glyph will be closer to the description by replacing the M16 shape on the head by M15.
But it is still not clear in the glyph that the lines below the mat connect to the flowers, rather than to the waterpots.

0x13794 0x136AE
These two are duplicates. This will be solved in Unicode 17 by making 0x136AE non-core.

0x13795
The uraeus in the glyph has been confirmed to be an error.
This will be solved in Unicode 17.
But the band around the head with the loop at the back will remain for now.
I suspect that is an error as well, as it is not mentioned in the description.
