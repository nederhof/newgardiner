0x13017 0x134CD
The staff in the original shape of 0x13017 already had a slight backward angle, unlike the Unicode 16 form, where the staff is perfectly vertical. This will be solved in Unicode 17 by redrawing 0x13017 to have the staff at a backward angle, like in the original shape. But note that then 0x13017 and 0x134CD will differ by no more than the exact degree of the angle, which seems an inappropriately small graphical distinction for the purposes of Unicode.

ok 0x1303A 0x1355D
Considering the hairstyles, 0x1303A was misplaced at 0x1355D. This will be solved in Unicode 17 by swapping the shapes and ancillary documentation of 0x1303A and 0x1355D from Unicode 16.

0x130C1
These are arguably only insignificant graphical variants of the same thing, but unless one can argue that one variant is real and the other variant is not real (never occurs), one should revert to the original Unicode 5.2 variant, and change description and image accordingly. Incidentally, both forms exist in GEG. Around 2009, there were discussions about which of the two was the most appropriate form for Unicode, and in consultation with Egyptologists it was decided to opt for the form in Unicode 5.2. Whether or not you agree this was the right decision should be irrelevant. Code charts should not be changed without a compelling reason.

0x130FE
The description suggests outward curving horns, unlike the Unicode 5.2 and Unicode 16 shapes. Some of the tokens in the TSL have outward curving horns and some have inward curving horns. Does it make sense to specify the curvature in the description when the curvature is so variable in actual inscriptions? How about just "with horns"?

ok 0x130F9 0x13ABE
The original shape of 0x130F9 unmistakably had whiskers. This will be solved in Unicode 17 by swapping the shapes and ancillary documentation of 0x130F9 and 0x13ABE from Unicode 16.

ok 0x130FA
In the original shape, the hare has whiskers. Moreover, the difference between 0x130FA and 0x130F9 should be in the height, while the width should be roughly the same, i.e. 0x130FA is flatter than 0x130F9. See Gardiner (1957) for the typographical motivation. Both issues will be solved in Unicode 17.

ok 0x130FB 0x13AE8
The original shape (tail up) was misplaced at 0x13AE8. This will be solved in Unicode 17 by swapping the shapes and ancillary documentation of 0x130FB and 0x13AE8 from Unicode 16.

ok 0x130FC
The original shape had the tail up. This will be solved in Unicode 17 by restoring the orientation of the tail.

0x13108 0x13B83
The original shape was misplaced at 0x13B83. The only reasonable solution is to swap shapes and ancillary documentation from Unicode 16.

0x13110
Even though these are insignificant graphical variants, code charts should not be changed without a good reason. Unless a compelling case can be made that the horn over the liquid cannot occur in real inscriptions, revert to the Unicode 5.2 form.

0x13112 0x13BB2
The appearance of 0x13112 has changed considerably and one could even argue that 0x13BB2 is closer to the original shape than to the new shape; both the original shape and 0x13BB2 clearly have sharp teeth while the new shape of 0x13112 does not. Gardiner (1957) characterizes the sign as "lower jaw-bone of ox", and as far as I know, oxen are not particularly known for having sharp teeth. But does this necessarily mean that the original shape of 0x13112 and 0x13BB2 differ in what they are meant to represent? Unless there is solid evidence that the original shape of 0x13112 was wrong or uncharacteristic, it may be better to revert the shape to something closer to Unicode 5.2. It is then an open question whether the current shape of 0x13BB2 deserves its own (core) code point.

0x1315D 0x13C5D
The description of 0x1315D does not match the images. The original shape has a standard closer to R92A. So if a graphical variant is needed with R12, then it should be at a new code point, so here that would be 0x13C5D. In other words, flip the ancillary documentation and give 0x13C5D the R12 shape. Unicode 17 will regrettably have this the wrong way around. I hope this can be corrected in Unicode 18.

0x13163 0x13C4A
It is by no more than a few black pixels, but it is unmistakable that the original shape was meant to exhibit a lappet. In other words, the shape of 0x13163 was misplaced at 0x13C4A. The only reasonable solution is to swap shapes and ancillary documentation from Unicode 16.

0x13164
Give the shape a lappet to revert to Unicode 5.2.

ok 0x13169 0x13168
The width of 0x13169 should be the same as that of 0x13168, but the height should be smaller. See Gardiner (1957) for the typographical motivation. This will be corrected in Unicode 17.

ok 0x1316B 0x1316A
The width of 0x1316B should be the same as that of 0x1316A, but the height should be smaller. See Gardiner (1957) for the typographical motivation. This will be corrected in Unicode 17.

0x131A6
Around 2009, there were protracted discussions about what the most appropriate orientation was for Unicode, since both orientations occur in GEG, and the sign was taken from iconography and is not attested in actual running text. In consultation with Egyptologists it was decided to opt for the form in Unicode 5.2. Whether or not you agree this was the right decision at the time, having studied (or not) the arguments laid out by Egyptologists in 2009, all this should be irrelevant. The glyph should not change on a whim relative to what it has been for the past 15 years since Unicode 5.2. If anyone feels a need for the other orientation, a variation selector for rotation can be used.

0x131C6
Revert to the shape from Unicode 5.2. The description in fact already correctly reflects the original shape.

0x131D8
It is unclear which sign is on top in Unicode 5.2, so fonts have the liberty to interpret this as desired, but at least make sure the shape is consistent with the description, which is currently not the case.

0x131F4 0x131F6 0x13EDE 0x13EDF 0x13EE0
There is no inner circle in the original shape of 0x131F4. One may argue this is an insignificant detail. But if one then introduces multiple code points 0x131F6 and 0x13EDE for the same sign with and without inner circle, and similarly 0x13EDF and 0x13EE0, then one simultaneously suggests that the inner circle is important and that the inner circle is not important. See also the Encoding Principles, which more often than not are divorced from what was actually done.

0x13227
The differences may be insignificant, but it appears to me that most of the description matches the original shape better than the Unicode 16 shape, in particular the orientation of the feather and the "short vertical line". This sign deserves to be revisited by an expert

0x13228
I think the description matches the spear better in the original shape than in the Unicode 16 shape. This sign deserves to be revisited by an expert.

0x13246
The Unicode 16 form does not seem to match the description, because it does not appear to have the usual R12 standard, as it does in the original. Also, in the original, the hare has whiskers.

0x1324A
This does not remotely seem to be the same character. Even if the original shape is wrong, in the sense of being a misinterpretation of actual inscriptions, the new shape would have deserved a new code point, rather than trying to recycle an existing code point for a totally different thing. It is a mystery to me where the current shape comes from; it has been in the code charts since at least Unicode 9.

0x1326E
The description of the shape of the roof matches the original shape but not the new shape.

0x13271
In the original, the sides were more oblique than vertical.

0x13277 0x13FDC
The original shape (without circle) was misplaced at 0x13FDC. The only reasonable solution is to swap shapes and ancillary documentation from Unicode 16.

0x1329F
The new shape is mirrored. Since there is a mirroring control, there is no reasonable justification for this, even if the sign normally occurs the other way around.

0x132BC 0x14107
The original shape of 0x132BC was misplaced at 0x14107. The only reasonable solution is to swap shapes and ancillary documentation from Unicode 16.

0x132F6
The description matches the original shape but not the new shape. In the new shape the piece of cloth is over the sickle.

0x1330C
The original shape underspecified which of the signs is on top. It seems fine to me to clarify the desired appearance, if there is a sufficient amount of evidence suggesting that one or the other form is correct. But the new shape should be consistent with the description. In the new shape, the cobra is under the mace.

0x1330D
The description matches the original shape but not the new shape. In the new shape the mace is over the cobras.

0x1331C 0x131C5 0x131D5
In the original code charts, the handle most certainly does not resemble M13 (0x131C5), If anything, it looks closer to 0x131D5.  I do not mind if the image in the code charts currently has that shape, as the shape of the handle seems a minor detail. But by putting "with a handle resembling ..." in the description you suggest that M13 is an essential part of the character identity of 0x1331C, whereas (as far as I know) scimitars do not generally have a handle resembling M13. The Database does not motivate departing from the original shape. The TSL has one single token (without citation!), which is rather blurry and does not seem to suggest M13 at all.

0x1332F
By plausible deniability one could argue the new shape underspecifies which sign is on top. But in Unicode 16, the shapes of overlays generally commit to one or the other. It would be better therefore to revert to the Unicode 5.2 shape.

0x13332
The original shape did not have a boss. It is fine to improve the appearance. But the new shape and the description do not seem to match. In the new shape, the boss is not really "in the center".

0x13341 0x1429C
It is unclear to me whether the original shape of 0x13341 is closer to its new shape, or whether it rather corresponds to 0x1429C. The original shape had a pronounced circle, like 0x1429C, while the new shape has more of a bulb. Does it even make sense to have two code points here?

0x1334C 0x1334B 0x142B7 0x142B8
The original shape of 0x1334C has a horizontal line on the top, so the new shape is wrong. The intended use of 0x1334C is for "a later form of U23" (Gardiner 1931) as found on the 26th Dyn. sarcophagus of Ankhnesneferibra (BM EA32). See the bottom-left corner of the image in the link below, where it reads at the end of the column "n mr=s n [...]"; there is most definitely a line on the top. The Database refers to the Pyramid of Unas, which is off by 2 millennia so this is unlikely to be relevant to 0x1334C. It is unclear to me how other newly introduced code points for hair-pins are supposed to relate to the original shape of 0x1334C, or even how to characterize the difference between 0x1334C and usual hairpin 0x1334B. It becomes an exercise in futility if new code points are introduced for barely distinguishable shapes, as if those are meaningful for Unicode, while the intentions of existing code points are distorted to turn them into totally different things. One either takes the character identities of code points seriously, or one does not, in which case why do we even bother with Unicode?

0x1335A
Apart from plausible deniability (see above), the description matches the original shape but not the new shape. In the new shape the spindle is over the viper.

0x13393
Apart from plausible deniability (see above), the description matches the original shape but not the new shape. It would be better to revert to the Unicode 5.2 shape.

0x1339C
Apart from plausible deniability (see above), the new shape, unlike the description, suggests the wick is over the arm. Make the new shape consistent with the description.

0x1339E
Even though these are insignificant graphical variants, code charts should not be changed without a good reason. Unless a compelling case can be made that the basket over the hank of fibre cannot occur in real inscriptions, revert to the Unicode 5.2 form.

0x1341B
The description matches the original shape but not the new shape. Correct the new shape to have the top line curve downwards.

0x13424
Apart from plausible deniability (see above), the new shape, unlike the description, suggests the object is over the arm. Make the new shape consistent with the description.

0x13427
Even though these are insignificant graphical variants, code charts should not be changed without a good reason. Unless a compelling case can be made that the "thin triangle" over the moon cannot occur in real inscriptions, revert to the Unicode 5.2 form.
