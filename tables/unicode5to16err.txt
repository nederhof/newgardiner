0x13007
The "knees down" seems to accurately describe the original form, but not the Unicode 16 form that UniKemet normally
describes as "seated on heel". Revert the glyph to the Unicode 5.2 form and make it consistent with the description.
<p>
In the Database there is "REDRAW (probably on the tips of his toes)", which points in the same direction.

ok 0x13017 0x134CD
The staff in the original shape of 0x13017 already had a slight backward angle, unlike the Unicode 16 form, where the staff is perfectly vertical. This has been solved in Unicode 17 by redrawing 0x13017 to have the staff at a backward angle, like in the original shape. But note that then 0x13017 and 0x134CD will differ by no more than the exact degree of the angle, which seems an inappropriately small graphical distinction for the purposes of Unicode.

ok 0x1303A 0x1355D
Considering the hairstyles, 0x1303A was misplaced at 0x1355D. This has been solved in Unicode 17 by swapping the shapes and ancillary documentation of 0x1303A and 0x1355D from Unicode 16.

0x13055
In the original shape, the hair is not long. The Database has
"Nederhof example is a different sign though [...]". Different from what? Also, it is not my example, it is *the* example that was *the*
justification for introducing this code point in Unicode 5.2 in the first place.
The only ground truth in determining what a code point should stand for is the original UniKemet database 
used to compile the Unicode 5.2 basic list. See p. 34 of:
<p>
https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06354-n3181-egyptian.pdf
<p>
It defines B005A as the sign in GITB 804-013-500:
<p>
http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/8rel100.pdf
<p>
In the transcription the hair is definitely not long. Unless one argues that the mentioned tomb relief was misread,
and no one has argued that so far, the hair should be short in the code charts.
In fact, the Database confirms that the sign in Page-Gasser & Wiese (1997)
has "short hair". One could argue that "no female features" might be a reason to adjust the glyph with regard to the original, 
but since there is no doubt the sign represents a female, no one should care to what extent the "female features" are accentuated in the glyph.
<p>
To be clear, I suspect the length of the hair is not part of the character identity, in which case
the description could omit mention of the length of the hair and leave it to the font to decide. 
But if the Database now argues there are two different signs,
then the question which of those two signs is the one that is represented by 0x13055 is unambiguously answered by the
original UniKemet database.

0x13057
For 0x13057, there was a uraeus in the original, now there is not. 
The Database motivates this by asserting that the uraeus was a mistake 
because it is not in Gardiner's source (Ann 42, 479), from the tomb of Kheruef. However, 
the reason why no uraeus is visible in that publication is simply because the font used
therein is too coarse to see such details:
<p>
https://archive.org/details/ASAE-42-1943/page/n251/mode/2up
<p>
If we look at the corresponding facsimile in Plate 56 of the following publication we do see the uraeus:
<p>
https://isac.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/shared/docs/oip102.pdf
<p>
This sign in the cartouche of queen Tiye consistently has the uraeus in that same tomb.
See also Plates 9, 10, 24, 26, 42, 49, 51, 57, 66.
So the Database is incorrect where it says "Gardiner added an uraeus, the token his sign is based on 
(which is the one encoded in TSL) does not actually have the uraeus, so the addition is erronious to begin with".
The uraeus wasn't added by Gardiner, it has always been there.
As to the TSL:
<p>
https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=1197
<p>
I find one token for queen Tiye (TSL_3_22183), but it is not the one that Gardiner refers to,
and with the blurry photo of this eroded inscription, one can debate whether traces of a uraeus might be visible.
It appears to be a case of both confirmation bias and circular reasoning to take a single token for queen Tiye,
after overlooking a dozen others, classify and transcribe it in the TSL 
as not having a uraeus because one cannot make out a uraeus in that single photo, and then to refer to the TSL as
evidence that the sign does not have a uraeus.
<p>
Especially when it comes to glyphs that have already been used for 15 years or more in 
encodings, fonts, tools, databases, and teaching materials, and where severe disruption is caused by any changes,
the bar should be far higher. There should be more thorough analysis, documentation and justification. And above all,
there should be more transparency. The default should be to leave things as they are unless there are clearly articulated
and convincing reasons to make changes.
<p>
The uraeus suggests royalty (personal communication wth Peter Dils), and so the change
of the glyph affected an important clue to the interpretation of the sign (Gardiner has "Det. of names of queens").

0x130C1
These are arguably only insignificant graphical variants of the same thing, but unless one can argue that one variant is real and the other variant is not real (never occurs), one should revert to the original Unicode 5.2 variant, and change description and image accordingly. Incidentally, both forms exist in GEG, and are in fact found in the same line (top line of p. 458). 
In 2005-2009, there were discussions about which of the two was the most appropriate form for Unicode, and in consultation with Egyptologists it was decided to opt for the form in Unicode 5.2. Whether or not one agrees now this was the right decision at the time
should be irrelevant. Code charts should not be changed without a compelling reason.

0x130FE
The description suggests outwards curving horns, unlike the Unicode 5.2 and Unicode 16 shapes. 
Some of the tokens in the TSL have outwards curving horns and some have inwards curving horns:
<p>
https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=2871
<p>
Does it make sense to specify the curvature in the description when the curvature is so variable in actual inscriptions? I propose
to change the description to just have "with horns"?

ok 0x130F9 0x13ABE
The original shape of 0x130F9 unmistakably had whiskers. This has been solved in Unicode 17 by swapping the shapes and ancillary documentation of 0x130F9 and 0x13ABE from Unicode 16. (There is no need though to make the length of the whiskers as exaggerated as they are currently
in 0x13ABE.)

ok 0x130FA
In the original shape, the hare has whiskers. Moreover, the difference between 0x130FA and 0x130F9 should be in the height, while the width should be roughly the same, i.e. 0x130FA is flatter than 0x130F9. See Gardiner (1957) for the typographical motivation. Both issues were solved in Unicode 17.

ok 0x130FB 0x13AE8
The original shape (tail up) was misplaced at 0x13AE8. This has been solved in Unicode 17 by swapping the shapes and ancillary documentation of 0x130FB and 0x13AE8 from Unicode 16.

0x130FC
The original shape had the tail up. This has been solved in Unicode 17 by restoring the orientation of the tail.
The Database links to p. 53, l. 6 and pl. DCXIX of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara007.pdf
<p>
Note that, first, a sign list is not a token list, and one cannot keep changing the code charts every time 
a new token is found that has a slightly different graphical feature, and second, it would be very hard to make out the position of the tail
in the coarse font of the transcription and in the blurry photo (of the online PDF). 
I propose removing mention of the tail in the description as overspecific. 
For many baboon signs in the extended list, the position of the tail is not mentioned either.
One trick to be entirely non-committal would be to move the baboon and the "sheath or receptacle" closer together so the
tail is hidden altogether.
<p>
One remaining issue is that the original shape didn't have the diamond marking. What is the justification for adding the diamond marking?
Neither transcription nor photo in the above link show the diamond marking.
The Database mentions another token and adds "nor is the diamond shape in the W3 that clear". This suggests to me 
that there was considerable doubt whether the diamond marking was correct to begin with. It might be safest to revert to
the Unicode 5.2 shape entirely and also remove the diamond marking.

0x13108 0x13B83
The original shape was misplaced at 0x13B83. The only reasonable solution is to swap shapes and ancillary documentation from Unicode 16.
<p>
In the Database there is not a shred of an acknowledgement that the shape of 0x13108 changed from Unicode 5.2 to Unicode 16, 
let alone a justification for the change.

0x13110
Even though these are insignificant graphical variants, code charts should not be changed without a good reason. Unless a compelling case can be made that the horn over the liquid cannot occur in real inscriptions, revert to the Unicode 5.2 form.

0x13112 0x13BB2
The appearance of 0x13112 has changed considerably and one could even argue that 0x13BB2 is closer to the original shape than to the new shape; both the original shape and 0x13BB2 have a single row of pointed teeth while the new shape of 0x13112 has two isolated rows of
less pointed teeth. Gardiner (1957) characterizes the sign as "lower jaw-bone of ox", and as far as I know, oxen are not particularly known for having pointed teeth. But does this necessarily mean that the original shape of 0x13112 and 0x13BB2 differ in what they are meant to represent? Unless there is solid evidence that the original shape of 0x13112 was wrong or uncharacteristic, it may be better to revert the shape to something closer to Unicode 5.2. It is then an open question whether the current shape of 0x13BB2 deserves its own (core) code point, or whether it is just a duplicate of 0x13112.
<p>
I don't see the original shape of 0x13112 anywhere in the Database, and there doesn't seem to be even a shred of an acknowledgement that the shape changed from Unicode 5.2 to Unicode 16, let alone a justification for the change.

0x1315D 0x13C5D
The glyphs of 0x1315D in Unicode 5.2 and Unicode 16 are virtually the same, and also the glyph at 0x13C5D looks very similar.
There is only a slight difference in that the vertical beam for 0x1315D is almost at the right end and the vertical beam for
0x13C5D is perfectly at the right end. The standard with the vertical beam perfectly at the right end is also known as
JSesh R92A.
Transcription practices don't seem to distinguish between "almost at the right end" and "perfectly at the right end".
For example, all of the tokens at:
<p>
http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1307
<p>
http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1400
<p>
http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1517
<p>
have a shape closer to 0x13C5D in the photo but a shape closer to 0x1315D in the transcription.
<p>
After querying whether 0x13C5D needs to exist at all next to 0x1315D, because they seem to be indistinguishable
for all practical purposes, there was the unexpected move to drastically change the glyph of 0x1315D by giving it a literal
R12 standard as in the description, that is, a standard with the vertical beam roughly in the middle, and objects attached
to the left end, and this became the Unicode 17 form.
This seems to be a much less common form for ibis-on-standard, 
even though it is the logo of the Thot Sign List. Most tokens seem to have a plain horizontal beam with attached objects and 
with the vertical beam perfectly or almost at the right end:
<p>
https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=3456
<p>
This change will effectively make encoders use 0x13C5D for the common shape that has formerly been at 
0x1315D from Unicode 5.2 until (and including) Unicode 16.
In this case as in other cases, moving or effectively moving glyphs to other code points 
does nothing but sow chaos and confusion,
causing many existing encodings to lose their validity overnight.
It would be enough to undermine users' trust in Unicode forever. 
<p>
In the case of 0x132BC and 0x14107 below, 
the Database seems to hint at a rationale for moving a glyph to a new code point because that glyph might
be less frequent than another graphical variant. (I don't follow the reasoning, but let's assume that for now.)
Here, it seems to be the exact opposite. The variant with R92A is more frequent by far than the variant with the literal R12,
and yet there is supposedly a reason to move it to a new code point?
I'm puzzled what one hopes to achieve with this.

0x13163 0x13C4A
It is by no more than a few black pixels, but it is unmistakable that the original shape was meant to exhibit a lappet. In other words, the shape of 0x13163 was misplaced at 0x13C4A. The only reasonable solution is to swap shapes and ancillary documentation from Unicode 16.

0x13164
Again, it is unmistakable that the original shape exhibited a lappet.
Ideally, one would revert to Unicode 5.2 and give the shape a lappet. However this case is of lesser importance.
The lappet is a low-level palaeographic detail 
that is of little relevance to Unicode anyway. The description does not need to have "with lappet",
and the code point should cover both tokens with lappet and without lappet.

ok 0x13169 0x13168
The width of 0x13169 should be the same as that of 0x13168, but the height should be smaller. See Gardiner (1957) for the typographical motivation. This has been corrected in Unicode 17.

ok 0x1316B 0x1316A
The width of 0x1316B should be the same as that of 0x1316A, but the height should be smaller. See Gardiner (1957) for the typographical motivation. This has been corrected in Unicode 17.

0x131A6 0x13DEE
In 2005-2009, there were protracted discussions about what the most appropriate orientation of 0x131A6 was for Unicode, since both orientations occur in GEG (p. 477 versus p. 545), and since the sign was taken from iconography and is not attested in actual running text.
In consultation with Egyptologists it was decided to opt for the form in Unicode 5.2, fixed formally by letting UniKemet
link the code point to the occurrence on p. 477 as opposed to the occurrence on p. 545.
This was motivated by similar signs (like the newly introduced 0x13DEE) that have the head up as well.
For more information, see pp. 8 and 39 of:
<p>
https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06354-n3181-egyptian.pdf
<p>
Whether or not one now agrees this was the right decision at the time, 
having studied (or not) the arguments laid out by Egyptologists in 2005-2009, 
all this should be irrelevant. 
The glyph should not change on a whim relative to what it has been for the past 15 years since Unicode 5.2. 
If anyone feels the need for the other orientation, a variation selector for rotation can be used.
<p>
Apropos, the Database has the fly with the head up as well, so it is not even clear to me any of the philologists 
actually wanted to have this sign rotated relative to the original orientation. In the end, the rotation may be due to clerical error.

0x131BA
No one should care about the length of the stalk in the glyph. This is a palaeographic detail and insignificant
at the level of Unicode.
I do object against the Database not even acknowledging that anything was changed, despite the fact that
the description above explicitly invalidates the character identity from Unicode 5.2 when the stalk was definitely not long.
In particular, there is nothing in the Database that suggests that a short stalk was wrong or atypical and therefore needed to be changed into
a long stalk.
The original form with the short stalk reappears in a different entry with the comment "Does not seem to be
a meaningful variant". Ok, but if the difference between the shapes was not significant, why was there any need for the shape to be changed?
<p>
So delete "long" from the description. Ideally one would also make the stalk a little shorter than the Unicode 16 form
but it could be a little longer than the Unicode 5.2 form.
<p>
I'm also reminded that the extended sign list introduced multiple code points 0x13C9D and 0x13C9F for a falcon
on a low cone and a falcon on a high cone. Similarly, separate code points 0x13A01 and 0x13A02
were introduced for a hand holding a long stick and a hand holding a short stick. Etc.
So apparently, it is important how big something is. But it is apparently not important anymore when it comes to 
existing code points, and no one thought twice about replacing the short stalk by the long stalk?
There seems to be a lack of consistency running through the entire Unicode 16 set.

0x131C6
Revert to the shape from Unicode 5.2. The description in fact already correctly reflects the original shape.

0x131D8
It is unclear which sign is on top in Unicode 5.2, so fonts have the liberty to interpret this as desired, but at least make sure the shape is consistent with the description, which is currently not the case. The current shape has the plant over the arm, not the arm over the plant.
<p>
Because the original shape did not fix which sign was on top, I would prefer for the description to leave this underspecified, by using
a phrase other than "written over". Perhaps "overlaid with"?

0x131F4 0x131F6 0x13EDE 0x13EDF 0x13EE0
There is no inner circle in the original shape of 0x131F4. One may argue this is an insignificant detail. But if one then introduces multiple code points 0x131F6 and 0x13EDE for the same sign with and without inner circle, and similarly 0x13EDF and 0x13EE0, then one simultaneously suggests that the inner circle is important and that the inner circle is not important. See also Point 5 of
the Encoding Principles, which more often than not are divorced from what was actually done:
<p>
https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr57/tr57-4.html#EncodingPrinciples
<p>
In the Database there is not a shred of an acknowledgement that the shape of 0x131FA changed from Unicode 5.2 to Unicode 16. 
The Database does have the shape without inner circle, but in a separate entry, with the comment "Technically the more common form".
Then what could possibly be the justification for changing the glyph if the Unicode 16 form is less common than the Unicode 5.2 form?

0x13227 0x14256
The differences of 0x13227 may be insignificant, but it appears to me that most of the description matches the original shape better than the Unicode 16 shape, in particular the orientation of the feather and the "short vertical line". 
It may be appropriate to revise the glyph, and consult an expert whether the shape is drawn correctly.
<p>
It also seems to me that 0x14256 is closer to the new shape of 0x13227 than the new shape of 0x13227 is to the original shape of 0x13227.
If 0x14256 is so fundamentally different that it warranted a new code point,
then how can one justify treating the old and new shapes of 0x13227 as interchangeable?
There seems to be no consistency in any of this.

0x13228
I think the description matches the spear better in the original shape than in the Unicode 16 shape. 
It may be appropriate to revise the glyph, and consult an expert whether the shape is drawn correctly.
<p>
Apropos, the Database refers to:
<p>
http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1585
<p>
The spear there is like in the Unicode 5.2 form, although the harpoon is more like the Unicode 16 form.

0x1324A 0x13CA7
The original shape of 0x1324A was misplaced at 0x13CA7. The original and current shapes of 0x1324A are not even remotely the same sign.
<p>
The Database writes "No token of this exact grapheme [the Unicode 16 glyph of 0x1324A] could yet be located". This means there was no reason 
for the sign to even be in Unicode and one should have kept the Unicode 5.2 shape for 0x1324A, because that is attested, for example
here:
<p>
http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1128
<p>
(Incidentally, this has a token closer to the original Unicode 5.2 form of 0x1324A than to the Unicode 16 form of 0x13CA7.)
<p>
The only reasonable solution is to swap shapes and ancillary documentation from Unicode 16. I would then make 
0x13CA7 non-core, as it will then get to harbor an unattested shape.

0x1326E
The description of the shape of the roof matches the original shape but not the new shape.
In the new shape the roof is symmetric, rather than sloping downwards towards the back, as I would understand it.

0x13271
In the original, the sides were more oblique than vertical.
In the TSL:
<p>
https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=4552
<p>
both the normalized glyph and some (but admittedly not all) of the tokens have oblique sides.
If the TSL does not provide convincing evidence to motivate changing the sides from oblique to vertical, 
then I don't think anything else will.
<p>
To be clear, we shouldn't even be talking about whether an angle is 90 degrees or 89 degrees.
That is not a meaningful distinction for Unicode. The issue is that the UniKemet documentation of the extended list
consistently makes a binary distinction whether sides of "building" signs are either vertical or oblique.
If anything, the tokens available for 0x13271 show that such a binary distinction is an illusion.
For any such sign, one will be able to find tokens with slightly different angles, some of which might be almost perfectly 90 degrees,
others will be visibly smaller. But by any reasonable measure it is still the same sign.

0x13277 0x13FDC
The original shape (without circle) was misplaced at 0x13FDC. The only reasonable solution is to swap shapes and ancillary documentation from Unicode 16.
<p>
The Database has a link to TSL_1_4521_01, where one finds both the shape with circle and the shape without circle. There are two
tokens without circle and one token with circle. The only thing this tells us is that the sign occurs both without circle
and with circle. It does not in any way tell us that the originally intended shape
of 0x13277 in Unicode 5.2 should have a circle. The only ground truth in this respect is the original UniKemet, which 
defines O025A to be the shape that occurs on p. 246 of Gardiner (1931) and on p. 4 of Gardiner (1953) and that
very clearly has no circle. Cf. p. 42 of:
<p>
https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06354-n3181-egyptian.pdf
<p>
and pp. 44 and 49 of:
<p>
https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2005/05313-Gardiner28-57.pdf
<p> 
Gardiner (1931) gives us some indication about the function of the sign: 
"Det. names of sun-obelisks". But this is consistent with the function "sun temple" listed by
the TSL to cover both the circled and the uncircled forms, and so also this offers no justification for changing the
shape of 0x13277.

0x1329F 0x1406E 0x1406F 0x1406A 0x1406B
The new shape of 0x1329F is mirrored. Since there is a mirroring control character, 
there is no reasonable justification for this, even if the sign often occurs the other way around.
Each and every existing encoding containing this sign from the past 15 years, no matter the orientation, 
will now have become invalid overnight due to this change.
<p>
Apparently the position was taken that the original glyph must have been an error because prow and stern 
are reversed relative to the more common orientation of boats. 
However, there are several examples of boats in the extended list where the orientation is not as expected either; 
e.g. 0x1406E versus 0x1406F and 0x1406A versus 0x1406B. It seems to happen particularly often in the writing of ḫntj, "sail south", that
prow and stern are reversed. It is inconceivable that Gardiner (1928) made a mistake due to being ignorant of
the difference between prow and stern, and it is far more likely that he needed this glyph for an inscription
where the boat was genuinely oriented as it was in Unicode 5.2.
<p>
The reversal of boats is also discussed in Section 40 of Fischer's "The Orientation Of Hieroglyphs":
<p>
https://archive.org/details/TheOrientationOfHieroglyphs/page/n143/mode/2up
<p>
Now one may take the position that the orientation of boats should be normalized to have the prow always
at the left, but then this is inconsistent with what was done elsewhere for the extended list.
The Database has "it probably exists somewhere, but I have no idea where", which rules out that
this matter was sufficiently analyzed to justify the disruption that this matter caused.

0x132B1
I don't mind the slight change of shape. But the "circular" in the description is overly specific.
The Database refers to p. 89, l. 2 of:
<p>
https://archive.org/details/MMAF25/page/n69/mode/2up
<p>
where admittedly the transcription has round items. But a cursory glance at R2 variants similar to 0x132B1 in the TSL:
<p>
https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=5320
<p>
shows us that the objects are not generally circular. I would even omit the exact number "three", because one will no doubt
find tokens with say four items.

0x132BC 0x14107
The original shape of 0x132BC was misplaced at 0x14107. The only reasonable solution is to swap shapes and ancillary documentation from Unicode 16.
<p>
There is no justification in the Database for changing the shape of 0x132BC.
The Database has "only(?) attested in Gardiner" suggesting that the original shape is a rare, anomalous form of the 
cloth-on-pole-and-butchers-block,
and therefore somehow deserves to be moved to another code point, although I cannot follow that reasoning at all
(frequency and code points are unrelated concepts).
But there is a photo of a token in the Database, and it didn't take me long to find another occurrence:
<p>
https://mnamon.sns.it/index.php?page=Immagini&id=32&img=5&lang=en
<p>
Another one possibly on p. 211 of:
<p>
https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdfplus/10.1086/671433
<p>
I have found more potential tokens, but often the issue is that in some texts the internal decoration of the butchers block 
takes the form of a single vertical line. It is then a matter of subjective judgement whether the thickness or position of that line 
differs enough from the pole to be seen as two different things.
A good example is:
<p>
https://journals.ekb.eg/article_402870_007f1ac8fd3d7458010f289771ab1391.pdf
<p>
The transcription has the sign with "pole-over-block", but upon closer inspection the photo seems to suggest "pole-on-block".
<p>
Altogether, it doesn't appear this is a rare sign at all, on the contrary,
and if ever special treatment is warranted for rare signs, 
then this does not apply here. In any case, moving a sign creates severe disruption to fonts and to encoders, and next to
these disadvantages, there are absolutely no advantages of any kind.

0x132F6
The description matches the original shape but not the new shape. In the new shape the piece of cloth is over the sickle.

0x1330C
The original shape underspecified which of the signs was on top, and it may be safest to leave this underspecified in the description.
In any case, the glyph should be consistent with the description. In the new shape, the cobra is *under* the mace.

0x1330D
The description matches the original shape but not the new shape. In the new shape the mace is over the cobras.

0x1331C 0x131C5 0x131D5
In the original code charts, the handle most certainly does not resemble M13 (0x131C5). 
If anything, it looks closer to 0x131D5. I do not mind much if the glyph in the code charts currently has that shape, as the shape of the handle seems a minor detail. But by putting "with a handle resembling ..." in the description, one is suggesting that M13 is an essential part of the character identity of 0x1331C, whereas (as far as I know) scimitars do not generally have a handle resembling M13. The Database does not motivate departing from the original shape. 
The TSL has one single token of T016A (without citation!), which is rather blurry and does not seem to suggest M13 at all:

I don't see the shape of M13 in any of them.
I would simply omit "with a handle resembling a stem of papyrus with a bud (M13)" as overspecific.

0x1332F
By plausible deniability one could argue the new shape underspecifies which sign is on top. But in Unicode 16, the shapes of overlays generally commit to one or the other. It would be better therefore to revert to the Unicode 5.2 shape.

0x13341 0x1429C
It is unclear to me whether the original shape of 0x13341 is closer to its new shape, or whether it rather corresponds to 0x1429C. The original shape had a pronounced circle, like 0x1429C, while the new shape has more of a bulb. Does it even make sense to have two code points here?

0x1334B
In isolation, I would have thought little of this slight change of shape, but see the below. It looks like the
shape that should have been at 0x1334C has been misplaced at 0x1334B.

The Database has "Redraw based on Gardiner". Great, but which sign from Gardiner? The original glyph is not at all like the new glyph,
and the old glyph reasonably accurately mimics the printed GEG.
By the way, I would not characterize the original shape as in the above description: what is between the two lines does not
form a clean oval. 

0x1334C 0x1334B 0x142B7 0x142B8
The original shape of 0x1334C has a horizontal line on the top, so the new shape is wrong. By the original UniKemet from 2006,
0x1334C stands for "a later form of U23" (Gardiner 1931) as found on the 26th Dyn. sarcophagus of Ankhnesneferibra (BM EA32).

There is most definitely a line on the top.

The Database provides no evidence of having even consulted the original UniKemet.
Instead, the Database
refers to the Pyramid of Unas, which is off by 2 millennia so this is unlikely to be relevant to 0x1334C. It is unclear to me how other newly introduced code points for hair-pins are supposed to relate to the original shape of 0x1334C, or even how to characterize the difference between 0x1334C and usual hairpin 0x1334B. It becomes an exercise in futility if new code points are introduced for barely distinguishable shapes, as if those are meaningful for Unicode, while exact specifications of existing code points are ignored to reuse these code points
for totally different things. One either takes the character identities of code points seriously, or one does not, in which case why do we even bother with Unicode?

0x1334D
The original shape had a round drill-bit.
The Database does not acknowledge that the shape of the drill-bit has changed, let alone offer a
justification for the change other than that JSesh happens to use a different form.
Given the many instances of round drill-bits among several newly introduced glyphs in the extended list, it is
uncontroversial that round drill-bits are very frequent in this and similar signs, and so there is no
rational basis for changing the Unicode form as it has existed since Unicode 5.2.
<p>
The phrase "a horizontal line on top of" is used elsewhere in UniKemet to mean something different from what is in the glyph.
What is in the glyph would elsewhere in UniKemet be phrased as "a horizontal line over";
cf. the descriptions of 0x142C7 and 0x142CB.

0x1335A
The description matches the original shape but not the new shape. In the new shape the spindle is over the viper.

0x1335D
The original did not depict the plummet as a heart.
I have no objection to the glyph being represented with greater clarity, but
is it part of the character identity that the plummet resembles a heart?
The Database has "only one token comes close, and it still lacks the heart", so I assume the answer is no.
It seems therefore better to leave out details that may well be hallucinated or uncharacteristic for the sign.
I propose simplifying both glyph and description.

0x13393
Apart from plausible deniability (see above), the description matches the original shape but not the new shape. It would be better to revert to the Unicode 5.2 shape.

0x1339C
Apart from plausible deniability (see above), the new shape, unlike the description, suggests the wick is over the arm. Make the new shape consistent with the description.
I would prefer for the description to leave underspecified which sign is on top, as it is not clear from the original shape either.

0x1339E
Even though these are insignificant graphical variants, code charts should not be changed without a good reason. Unless a compelling case can be made that the basket over the hank of fibre cannot occur in real inscriptions, revert to the Unicode 5.2 form and change the
description accordingly.

0x1341B
The description matches the original shape but not the new shape. Correct the new shape to have the top line curve downwards.

0x13424
Apart from plausible deniability (see above), the new shape, unlike the description, suggests the object is over the arm. Make the new shape consistent with the description.
I would prefer for the description to leave underspecified which sign is on top, as it is not clear from the original shape either.

0x13427
The original glyph had triangle-over-moon while the new form has moon-over-triangle.
This may have been motivated by a single token in the TSL that has moon-over-triangle:
<p>
https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=987
<p>
No doubt one will also find examples of triangle-over-moon, and I don't
see a compelling reason why the glyph should have changed.
Nonetheless, this sign differs from some other cases discussed here in that it cannot 
reasonably be obtained using the OVERLAY control, and therefore the kinds of problems discussed 
in the dedicated section below on overlays do not arise here.
However, the description ("moon [...] written over [...] triangle") should in any case be made
less specific so it does not explicitly contradict the original glyph, which should
remain an acceptable alternative graphical realization of this code point.
