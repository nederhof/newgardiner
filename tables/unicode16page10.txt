0x13E74 0x13E75
In 0x13E74, there is mention of a "flower", while in 0x13E75, what to me looks like the same shape is called a "bud". 
Can that be right?

0x13E81
More fluent would perhaps be "with the flowers at the sides oriented outwards".

0x13E82 0x13E81
Presumably, a "bud" looks different from a "flower". Yet the three things in
the glyph of 0x13E82 look identical. My hunch is that the two things on either side should look like the buds in 0x13E81.

0x13E8A
The description seems a bit longer than necessary, unless I misinterpret it. 
How about just "A pool or strip of land with three vertical lotus buds."?
<p>
I see three ticks on top of the land, but I don't think these are important enough to mention.

0x13E9C
Font-technical problem (anti-)clockwise?

0x13EAA
Apparently "bolls" are "rounded seed capsules of plants
such as cotton or flax". What is on top in the glyph is square, not rounded.
Is a redraw needed?

0x13EAB 0x131E7
The "near the bottom of the bundle" of 0x13EAB doesn't seem to match the glyph.
<p>
Also, does adding 0x13EAB next to 0x131E7 not
violate Point 5 of the Encoding Principles "Signs that exist with and without inner detailing will be included with the inner detailing"?

0x13EB2
If it is really necessary to have a sign specifically for 2*4 pieces, then at
least make the glyph consistent. There are 9 pieces in the glyph.
<p>
My preference would be to underspecify the number of pieces. If the number of rows is significant 
(and I'm not even convinced of this), one can mention that, e.g.:
<p>
"A basket with two rows [or layers] of pieces of grain or fruit."

0x13EB5 0x13EB4
Adding 0x13EB5 next to 0x13EB4 seems hardly appropriate for Unicode. 
It appears to be overtly paleographic, and such details are lost in ordinary font sizes and coarse fonts may omit these details anyway.
<p>
Also related in spirit to Point 5 of the Encoding Principles.

0x13EEC
The glyph suggests the uraeus is in the far corner away from the wings, with a very long tail.
However, in the photo of the token pointed to by the Database:
<p>
http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/4225
<p>
the uraeus is closer to the center of the space between the wings.

0x13EF8
Ok, but it is difficult to make out the smallest of the three circles. Perhaps
a slight improvement to the glyph might be made to bring out all three circles clearly.

0x13F03
In the glyph, there are *four* horizontal lines, not three. Now, I'm not saying that counting lines is a good thing. My suggestion in keeping with other descriptions in this family of signs would be in the first instance (but see below):
<p>
"A parcel of land with irrigation ditches, at right angles."

0x13F05 0x13F06
In both cases, the lines "extend beyond each other". If the glyphs are accurate, then a different way should be found to phrase the difference between 0x13F05 and 0x13F06 (and preferably not by counting lines). Is it the orientation of the angles, sloping "forward" or sloping "backward"?
<p>
But then the question is why the mirroring control could not be used.

0x13F0A
In keeping with the above, I would say here for 0x13F0A:
<p>
"A parcel of land with irrigation ditches, at right angles."
<p>
and then the description of 0x13F03 could be expanded to be distinct from this:
<p>
"A parcel of land with irrigation ditches, at right angles, the horizontal lines extending beyond the leftmost and rightmost vertical lines."

0x13F11
In the glyph the viper is *under* the tree.
