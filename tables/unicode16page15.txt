0x14322
It may be good to clarify that S29 is mirrored horizontally (assuming the glyph is correct).

0x14324
In the glyph, there is a stroke under the egg. Whatever that is, can/should that stroke be mentioned in the description?

0x1432F 0x13393
In the glyph of 0x1432F, it is not "written over" as it is usually interpreted.
<p>
Further, the introduction of this code point next to 0x13393, or at all, is poorly justified.
The Database has:
<p>
"Seems to occur when the
text is arranged to fit something as if it is a normal I10. If used in this capacity, it needs to be atomic." 
<p>
The "fit something as if [...]" is too vague. Such matters need to be adequately documented.
Also, because the bounding boxes of the two shapes have roughly the same aspect ratio,
I cannot imagine that the difference between the shapes matters for the purpose of formatting complex groups, 
unless the overlay is used in combination with an
insertion of a big sign in the bottom left corner, in which case the shape of 0x1432F is preferable.
But as noted before, the implementation can choose an appropriate form of an overlay depending
on whether there are insertions, obviating the need for 0x1432F (and of 0x13393 for that matter).
<p>
Once again, I note that e.g. the flat hare 0x130FA and the flat swallow 0x1316B, which are typically used
in vertical arrangements, were deprecated because they "only" served to arrange signs in a better way.
And yet the only justification for the introduction of 0x1432F is that it serves to arrange signs
in a better way.
There is no coherent vision behind what was done.

0x14352 0x14353 0x14354
Cannot parse. Probably meant is "tied-off" (double f and hyphen).

0x14367
Cannot parse "base nearly a point". Perhaps something like "with a pointy base" is better?

0x143AF
The image in the code charts seems broken at the spout.

0x143DA
There appears to be uraeus or head of vulture near headdress. Is that real?

0x143EF
Remove "with, ".
