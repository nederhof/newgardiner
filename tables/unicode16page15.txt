ok 0x14322
In Unicode 17 it will be clarified that S29 is mirrored horizontally.

ok 0x14324
In the glyph, there is a stroke under the egg, not mentioned in the description.
The Database refers to p. 80, l. 13 and pl. CXCIII of:
<p>

<p>
In the photo, the shape in fact occurs twice,
once as part of running text and once in iconography, and in both cases there is a pronounced stroke under the egg.
<p>
From Unicode 17, this is addressed by adding "stroke shaped like an eyebrow" to the description.

0x1432F 0x13393
In the glyph of 0x1432F, it is not "written over" as it is usually interpreted.
<p>
Further, the introduction of this code point next to 0x13393, or at all, is poorly justified.
The Database has:
<p>
"Seems to occur when the
text is arranged to fit something as if it is a normal I10. If used in this capacity, it needs to be atomic." 
<p>
The "fit something as if [...]" is too vague. What I understand from the pointer in the Database to:
<p>
http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/4225
<p>
is that the intended use of 0x1432F is with insertion in the bottom left corner.
But as noted before, the implementation can choose an appropriate form of an overlay depending
on whether there are insertions, obviating the need for 0x1432F (and of 0x13393 for that matter).
<p>
Once again, I note that e.g. the flat hare 0x130FA and the flat swallow 0x1316B, which are typically used
with vertical joiners, were deprecated because they "only" served to arrange signs in a better way.
And yet the only justification for the introduction of 0x1432F is that it serves to arrange signs
in a better way.
There is no coherent vision behind what was done.

0x143DA
There appears to be uraeus or head of vulture near headdress. Is that real?

Remove "with, ".
