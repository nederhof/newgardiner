0x13461
I feel "both" places an unnecessary and misleading emphasis on the plurality of "knees", because only one knee is visible after all. Can "both" be omitted?
Same for 0x13463, 0x13464, 0x13465, 0x13469, 0x1346C, 0x1346D, 0x1346F, 0x13471, 0x13474, 0x13478, 0x1347A, 0x1347D, 0x1347F, 0x13480,

Whatever "knees horizontal" is meant to convey, it may already be implied by "knees forwards".

0x13472
At least one of "hand vertical, hand palm towards the face, in front of the face" seems redundant.

0x13473 0x13462 0x13000
The "left foot horizontal" in the description of 0x13473 suggest its glyph is wrong and should be
like the position of the feet in 0x13462.
The Database seems to point in the same direction,
using a blurry image that may suggest that the left foot is more likely to be horizontal than vertical.
What this blurry image does not convince me of is that the "right foot [is] in front of the left knee".
<p>
More generally, it is not clear to me whether the exact position of the right foot in such signs, 
a few pixels further to the left or to the right (a non-discrete difference regardless of whether
the right foot then happens to be in front of the left knee), 
is ever significant and worth including in the description.
A case in point may be 0x13462, which seems to be functionally identical to 0x13000.
Is the one poorly preserved example in the Database the only token that "verifies" the status of 0x13462
as independent sign rather than a casually carved instance of 0x13000?

0x134A8
The "front arm" is quite confusing. It is not the arm closest to the reader (I guess) but the arm connected to the shoulder closest to an
imaginary person facing the man. Why not just "left arm" to disambiguate?

0x134BB
Don't use the expression "facing upwards" where the face is looking downwards. Perhaps "Man [...] with his back down [...]"? 

0x134BF
"elbow bend downwards" s.b. "elbows [plural] bent downwards".

0x134C5
The glyph has the hand palms inward. Is the description wrong or is the glyph wrong?
The Database points to line 16 of:
<p>
https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA893
<p>
Can anyone really tell the orientation of the hands from this badly carved stela, with a crack
roughly where the hands are? If not, can the orientation of the hands be omitted from the description as overspecific?

0x134D2
Is it just a "backward line"? The glyph suggests it is something more, namely presence of a notch, making this M4.
The Database points to p. 287, l. 4 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara015.pdf
<p>
which does seem to suggest existence of the notch.

0x134D6
"right arm in forward" should be "in front"?

0x134E4 0x134E3
The hairstyle in the glyph of 0x134E4 does not appear to be a coif.
The Database does not contain a reference to a token. In contrast, the Database does 
contain a reference for 0x134E3, namely pl. 218 and pl. 219 of:
<p>
https://isac.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/shared/docs/oip51.pdf
<p>
but no hairstyle is mentioned in the description of 0x134E3. 
It seems inconsistent to be overly specific about hairstyle when the token could not be verified, while
not specifying the hairstyle at all when a very clear photo is available.
My preference would be not to specify hairstyles where it does not seem to matter much.

0x13527
In the glyph, the hand palms are inward or upward, but certainly not outward.
The Database refers to p. 159, l. 12 and pl. 115 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara011.pdf
<p>
The transcription certainly has the hand palms inward or upward. The photo is not clear
enough to tell.

0x13528
The glyph does not have both knees raised.
<p>
The Database has "Attested in TSL, not considered a meaningful variant [of A005A]". What was not a meaningful variant, the
shape with both knees raised as in the description, or the shape with one knee raised as in the glyph? 
And why did the sign end up in the core set nonetheless, on the basis of what graphical differences?

ok 0x1352A
The glyph has four flowers, not three.
To avoid inconsistency between description and glyph, the
description in Unicode 17 will have "several papyrus flowers".

ok 0x1352C
The description in Unicode 17 will be corrected to have "left knee raised", consistent with the glyph.

0x13541
The latest draft description is:
<p>
"Man, standing, back bent forwards, arms raised on either side of the body, bent at the elbow, hands at the height of the shoulders, holding an oar with both hands at 45Â° with the blade downwards."
<p>
If the oar is at 45 degrees, and the hands are both on the oar, then the hands cannot both be at the height of the shoulders. I think the description tries to be overly precise, to the point of no longer making sense. I would omit "hands at the height of the shoulders".
