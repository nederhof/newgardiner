I feel "both" places an unnecessary and misleading emphasis on the plurality of "knees", because only one knee is visible after all. Can "both" be omitted?

Whatever "knees horizontal" is meant to convey, it may already be implied by "knees forwards".

0x13472
At least one of "hand vertical, hand palm towards the face, in front of the face" seems redundant.

0x13473
Should be "right foot horizontal"? Or is the glyph wrong?

0x134A8
The "front arm" is quite confusing. It is not the arm closest to the reader (I guess) but the arm connected to the shoulder closest to an
imaginary person facing the man. Why not just "left arm" to disambiguate?

0x134BB
Don't use the expression "facing upwards" where the face is looking downwards. Perhaps "Man [...] with his back down [...]"? 

0x134BF
"elbow bend downwards" s.b. "elbows [plural] bent downwards".

0x134C5
The glyph has the hand palms inward. Is the description wrong or is the glyph wrong?

0x134D2
Is it just a "backward line"? The glyph suggests it is something more (M4?).

0x134D6
"right arm in forward" should be "in front"?

0x134E4
The hairstyle in the glyph does not appear to be a coif.

0x13527
In the glyph, the hand palms are inward or upward, but certainly not outward.

0x13528
The glyph does not have both knees raised.

ok 0x1352A
The glyph has four flowers, not three.
To avoid inconsistency between description and glyph, the
description in Unicode 17 will have "several papyrus flowers".

ok 0x1352C
The description in Unicode 17 will be corrected to have "left knee raised", consistent with the glyph.

The latest draft description is:
<p>
"Man, standing, back bent forwards, arms raised on either side of the body, bent at the elbow, hands at the height of the shoulders, holding an oar with both hands at 45Â° with the blade downwards."
<p>
If the oar is at 45 degrees, and the hands are both on the oar, then the hands cannot both be at the height of the shoulders. I think the description tries to be overly precise, to the point of no longer making sense. I would omit "hands at the height of the shoulders".
