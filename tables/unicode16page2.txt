The glyph suggests an object held in the left hand.
This was confirmed to be an error.
The Unicode 17 glyph will no longer depict the object.

The extended list aimed to distinguish between gods (to be systematically depicted with curved beards) and kings 
(to be systematically depicted with straight beards). However, more often than
not, the glyphs in Unicode 16 are inconsistent with this principle, as exemplified above.
Unicode 17 will correct many god and king signs.

0x136C6 0x136C7
In the glyph of 0x136C7, there is something that looks like a headrest, not mentioned in the description,
although the description does mention a "long straight beard", which might have been misinterpreted as
headrest when the glyph was created.
The headrest was confirmed to be an error, and will be removed from the glyph in Unicode 17.
But now the Unicode 17 glyph also doesn't have a beard, whereas the beard is still mentioned
in the description.

Further, what appears to be a uraeus in 0x136C6 is reportedly an error and will be removed in Unicode 17.
The description of 0x136C7 in Unicode 17 still mentions a uraeus, while
the glyph of 0x136C7 in Unicode 17 no longer depicts a uraeus. It needs to be double-checked
with the philologists what the intention was.

Incidentally, 0x136C6 was reportedly not meant to become a core sign in Unicode 16, 
but is still marked as core sign in Unicode 17.

ok The glyph depicts only one arm. In Unicode 17, the description will be corrected to "arm raised in front".
