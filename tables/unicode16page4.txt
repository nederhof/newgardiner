ok 0x13860 0x13861
The hair in the glyph of 0x13860 is not long (like it is in 0x13861). This will be corrected in Unicode 17.

0x13865
No arm is visible in the glyph. My suggestion is to replace "arm forward, forearm following the angle of the upper leg, hand on the knee, horizontally, handpalm up, supporting" by simply "holding". Overly precise descriptions tend to be inconsistent with the glyphs
in the code charts. And anyway, who cares. The character identity could be captured by as little as "Seated ibis-headed god holding face".
<p>
The Database mentions existence of one very detailed token where the arm is visible and argues that this should be
made visible in the glyph. But please realise that a character set is a list of types, not a list of tokens. 
A character is an abstraction of instances, not a facsimile of the most detailed instance of a character that you can find.

0x1386A
The glyph does suggests a sun disk (in the middle above the horns). This has been confirmed to be an error.
In Unicode 17 one of the circles on the crown will be removed, but it is regrettably the wrong circle; the circle
on top of the crown should remain.

0x13872
Should there be beards in the glyph if they are not mentioned in the description?

0x13876 0x1387F 0x13881 0x138BA 0x138BB
Correct "holding a holding" to "holding". Do global search-and-replace as there are many more occurrences.

0x13892
Correct "size of the king" to "size of the goddess".

0x13897 0x13899
For both, I think I also see the outlines of a vulture headdress in the glyph. Is that real?

0x1389F
The ankh sign is not angling forward in the glyph.
Not sure anyone should care, but description and glyph should be consistent.

0x138E3 0x138E4 0x138E8
In all three glyphs, the hand on the knee seems to hold an ankh sign as well, not mentioned in the description.
For 0x138E3 and 0x138E4, the Database points to p. 215 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara015.pdf
<p>
For 0x138E3 see l. 4, and for 0x138E4 see l. 10. The resolution of the PDF is low, but I would be
inclined to see an ankh sign in the tokens.
For 0x138E8, the Database points to p. 227, l. 11 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Esna007.pdf
<p>
This definitely has an ankh sign.
The forked bottom mentioned in the description is not visible in the transcription, so this mention should probably be removed.

0x138F8
The ankh sign mentioned in the description is not in the glyph.
The Database points to p. 12 of:
<p>
https://archive.org/details/MMAF23/page/n15/mode/2up
<p>
This does seem to confirm existence of the ankh sign.

0x138F9 0x138F8
The "circle" in 0x138F9 looks perfectly identical to the "round vessel" from 0x138F8.
If it is really just a circle (representing the sun?) and not a round vessel, then make sure it is perfectly round in the glyph.

0x13903
Left and right need to be reversed in the description.
The token pointed to by the Database confirms this, on p. 355 of:
<p>
https://archive.org/details/ASAE-40-1-1940/page/n181/mode/2up
<p>
Had the description been less specific, the inconsistency would not have occurred.
Consider for example "[...] one hand holding [...] and the other hand holding [...]".

0x13904
For the god, left and right are reversed. 
The Database points to p. 186 and plate 175 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara012.pdf
<p>
Both photo and transcription seem to confirm the glyph and contradict the description.
Of course, if the description had been less overly specific, then the inconsistency would not have arisen.

0x1391D
The glyph seems to have several "notches" on the palm branch, yet "notch forward" suggests there is precisely one.
The Database points to p. 351 of:
<p>
https://archive.org/details/ASAE-40-1-1940/page/n179/mode/2up
<p>
This does look like the glyph, and there is no single clear notch.
The issue would be solved by a description that is less specific. Perhaps write instead
"with M4 on her head".

0x1392B 0x1392C
For both signs, I think goddess and god are both holding ankh signs in the glyphs; are those real? 
I also think the goddess has the vulture headdress; is that real?

ok 0x1393F
The glyph has the handpalm inward. This will be corrected in Unicode 17.

0x13955
Correct "an coif" to "and coif". Is the ankh sign in the glyph real?

0x13956
In the glyph, the hand palm is inward.
