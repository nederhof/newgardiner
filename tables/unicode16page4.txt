ok 0x13860 0x13861
The hair in the glyph of 0x13860 is not long (like it is in 0x13861). This will be corrected in Unicode 17.

0x1386A
The glyph does suggests a sun disk (in the middle above the horns). This has been confirmed to be an error.
In Unicode 17 one of the circles on the crown will be removed, but it is regrettably the wrong circle; the circle
on top of the crown should remain.

ok 0x1393F
The glyph has the handpalm inward. This will be corrected in Unicode 17.
