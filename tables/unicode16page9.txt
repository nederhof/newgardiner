0x13D64 0x13192
In the glyph of 0x13D64, the top and bottom lines have the same length. Copy-and-past
error from 0x13192 in the description? Or is the glyph wrong?

0x13D72
In the glyph, the cobra is *under* the white crown, not *over*.

0x13D92
The mention of the forked base is strange, as the base is not visible.

0x13DA8
Font-technical issue at face of falcon, clockwise/counter-clockwise?

0x13DAB 0x13DAD 0x13DAE
What is the difference between "standing up" and "its tail coiled up, in a
single coil"? In the glyphs, it is just the height of the tail that differs
between 0x13DAB and 0x13DAD, and 0x13DAE actually appears to have a tail closer to 0x13DAB than to 0x13DAD.
<p>
Another example where consistency between fonts will be impossible to achieve, and the graphical distinctions that
have been made seem inappropriately fine-grained for Unicode.

0x13DB1 0x13DB2
If it is really necessary to distinguish these two (they are functionality
identical and as close as say the hare from the flat hare in appearance), then "lower than"
is insufficient to distinguish 0x13DB1 from 0x13DB2. In the glyph, the coils are about half the height of the head. If this is accurate, then I would write "about half the height" rather than "lower than".

0x13DB6
In the glyph, the "hole" unmistakably looks like one end of the pt sign. Is that intentional?
See:
<p>
https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=36
<p>
Here the shape in the normalized font looks like that in Unicode, 
but the image of the token more plausibly looks like the description, with a rounded "hole".

0x13DBB 0x13DBE
What is the difference that justifies the multiple code points for such similar graphical variants? The "head upward" ? Or the exact angle of the knifes?  In fact the head in 0x13DBE is less "upward" than in 0x13DBB.
<p>
Once again I'm astonished that clearly distinct graphical variants among the basic list have been made Legacy, while almost indistinguishable variants were introduced as core signs.

0x13DD3 0x13DD5
I appreciate the fishes are difficult, because the graphical distinctions can
be subtle and variable and often encoders need to rely more on function than
on appearance, but even so, the above is a problem because the description of
0x13DD3 subsumes that of 0x13DD5 and the functions are identical. If 0x13DD5
is characterized by particular fins, then 0x13DD3 deserves to be characterized by particular (other) fins as well.

0x13DD7 0x13DD8
As above. One description subsumes the other. The functions are identical.

0x131A3 0x13DE1 0x13DE2
If the "multiple vertical lines" are sufficient reason to distinguish 0x13DE1
from 0x131A3, then the "multiple vertical lines" in 0x13DE2 deserve to be
mentioned as well. (That is provided the "multiple vertical lines" in the
glyph of 0x13DE2 are real.)

0x13DE7
In the glyph, the wings are not remotely connected and I would not even say the wings make a circular form.  I think I know what is meant by "circular form", e.g. the winged scarab pectoral of Tutankhamun has a full circular form with the sun disk in between at the top (and a nb sign at the bottom). 0x13DE7 is not that.

0x13E09 0x13E0A
Correct "at the bottom".
<p>
The glyph of 0x13E0A looks quite strange. Could further guidance be provided
how to interpret the different lines in the given glyph? Could one consider normalizing the glyph to help the user interpret what is drawn?

0x13E20 0x13E27
Overtly violates Point 5 of the Guidelines "Signs that exist with and without inner detailing will be included with the inner detailing".

0x13E41 0x13E42
Apart from the violation of Point 5 of the Guidelines, the description of
0x13E42 is inaccurate. At best, correct 0x13E42 to "without".

0x13E44 0x13E47
I don't see how anyone can possible justify having the second next to the first. For similar cases of trivial graphical variants in the basic list, there was apparently a decision to make one of them Legacy. I see no consistency. The two shapes are functionally equivalent.

0x13E5E 0x13376
The way the root of 0x13E5E is drawn does not exactly suggest V9 (0x13376).
