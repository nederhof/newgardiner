0x13D64 0x13192
In the glyph of 0x13D64, the top and bottom lines have the same length. 
The Database points to p. 59 l. 7 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Esna007.pdf
<p>
where the top and bottom lines have the same length.
This is a normalized transcriptions, so this is not necessarily conclusive.
<p>
But anyway, who cares?
No doubt one can find tokens where the lines have the same length and tokens where the lengths clearly differ.
Conversely, one can find tokens of 0x13192 where top and bottom lines have the same length;
see for example the facsimile on p. 66 (bottom line) of the above publication.
<p>
The obvious solution of course is to make descriptions less overly specific.

0x13D72
In the glyph, the cobra is *under* the white crown, not *over*.

0x13D92
The mention of the forked base is strange, as the base is not visible.

0x13DA5
In the glyph there is a sun disk on the headdress, not mentioned in the description.
The Database refers to p. 36, l. 13 and pl. 27, col. 66. of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara010.pdf
<p>
The transcription has a sun disk, but it would be hard to confirm its existence in the photo.
So it may be best to leave underspecified whether there is a sun disk.
The problem is now that many other descriptions in UniKemet are overspecific and would mention the sun disk
if it is visible in the inscription. I think the only viable way forward is to remove extraneous detail from
the descriptions, so the sign list becomes an actual list of signs rather than a list of tokens.

0x13DA8
Font-technical issue at face of falcon, clockwise/counter-clockwise?

0x13DAB 0x13DAD 0x13DAE
What is the difference between "standing up" and "its tail coiled up, in a
single coil"? In the glyphs, it is just the height of the tail that differs
between 0x13DAB and 0x13DAD, and 0x13DAE actually appears to have a tail closer to 0x13DAB than to 0x13DAD.
<p>
Another example where consistency between fonts will be impossible to achieve, and the graphical distinctions that
have been made seem inappropriately fine-grained for Unicode.

0x13DB1 0x13DB2
If it is really necessary to distinguish these two (they are functionality
identical and as close as say the hare from the flat hare in appearance), then "lower than"
is insufficient to distinguish 0x13DB1 from 0x13DB2. In the glyph, the coils are about half the height of the head. If this is accurate, then I would write "about half the height" rather than "lower than".

0x13DB6
In the glyph, the "hole" unmistakably looks like one end of the pt sign. Is that intentional?
See:
<p>
https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=36
<p>
Here the shape in the normalized font looks like that in Unicode, 
but the image of the token more plausibly looks like the description, with a rounded "hole".

0x13DBB 0x13DBE
What is the difference that justifies the multiple code points for such similar graphical variants? The "head upward" ? Or the exact angle of the knifes?  In fact the head in 0x13DBE is less "upward" than in 0x13DBB.
<p>
Once again I'm astonished that clearly distinct graphical variants among the basic list have been made Legacy, while almost indistinguishable variants were introduced as core signs.

0x13DD3 0x13DD5
I appreciate the fishes are difficult, because the graphical distinctions can
be subtle and variable and often encoders need to rely more on function than
on appearance, but even so, the above is a problem because the description of
0x13DD3 subsumes that of 0x13DD5 and the functions are identical. If 0x13DD5
is characterized by particular fins, then 0x13DD3 deserves to be characterized by particular (other) fins as well.

0x13DD4
The glyph does not have the "loop under the horizontal beam".
The Database refers to:
<p>
http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/4205
<p>
The transcription and photo seem to confirm the loop (rather than the diagonal beam).

0x13DD7 0x13DD8
As above. One description subsumes the other. The functions are identical.

0x13DDF 0x13DDC 0x13DDD
I don't think it is accurate to call the tail fin in the glyph of 0x13DDF a "V like shape". 
The tail in 0x13DDC is arguably V-shaped, as the description says, but the tail in 0x13DDF is closer to that of 0x13DDD.

0x131A3 0x13DE1 0x13DE2
If the "multiple vertical lines" are sufficient reason to distinguish 0x13DE1
from 0x131A3, then the "multiple vertical lines" in 0x13DE2 deserve to be
mentioned as well. (That is provided the "multiple vertical lines" in the
glyph of 0x13DE2 are real.)

0x13DE7
In the glyph, the wings are not remotely connected and I would not even say the wings make a circular form.  I think I know what is meant by "circular form", e.g. the winged scarab pectoral of Tutankhamun has a full circular form with the sun disk in between at the top 
(and a nb sign at the bottom); see link below. 0x13DE7 is not that.
<p>
https://egypt-museum.com/winged-scarab-pectoral-of-tutankhamun/
<p>
There is a photo in the Database, but that does not have the "connecting" of the wings either.
The Database further points to p. 152, l. 12 of:
<p>
https://archive.org/details/MMAF25/page/n87/mode/2up
<p>
Also this does not have the "circular form". Why then is the description as it is?

0x13E09 0x13E0A
Correct "at the bottom".

0x13E20 0x13E27
Overtly violates Point 5 of the Encoding Principles "Signs that exist with and without inner detailing will be included with the inner detailing".

0x13E41 0x13E42
Apart from the violation of Point 5 of the Encoding Principles, the description of
0x13E42 is inaccurate. At best, correct 0x13E42 to "without".

0x13E44 0x13E47
I don't see how anyone can possible justify having the second next to the first. For similar cases of trivial graphical variants in the basic list, there was apparently a decision to make one of them Legacy. I see no consistency. The two shapes are functionally equivalent.
<p>
The Database has "I am not certain this [0x13E47] would be a meaningful variant". Quite.

0x13E48 0x13E4B
The glyph interprets the shape of 0x13E48 differently from the description. 
The glyph is drawn as 7 overlapping heart-shaped petals, while the description sees 7 non-overlapping oval-shaped petals surrounded
by a wavy circle. From the pointer in the Database:
<p>
http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/4081
<p>
I would say the description is right and the glyph is wrong (or at least misleading).
<p>
However, the photo shows the token does not have 7 but rather 6 petals, while the transcription has 8 petals! 
This shows once again that having such overly specific descriptions in UniKemet is untenable.
In this case, the obvious solution is not to include the exact number of petals in the description.
Then the question becomes whether 0x13E4B deserves an independent code point.

0x13E5E 0x13376
The way the root of 0x13E5E is drawn does not exactly suggest V9 (0x13376).
