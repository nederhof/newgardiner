0x1356F
The glyph has left and right hands switched around. It is a legitimate question whether the description needs to be this precise.
Something like "hands holding a two-pronged mast [...]" would be perfectly adequate.

0x13584 0x13585
The description of x13584 has "bent slightly forwards" while the description of 0x13585 does not.
Yet, apart from the position of the left arm, the poses in the two glyphs are 100% identical.
If it is necessary to so precisely describe the pose, then at least make sure that the glyphs
reflect what the descriptions say. My preference would be to make descriptions less precise.

ok 0x1359E
As the crossed arms are not visible in the glyph, Unicode 17 will change the description to have "hands sticking out".

ok 0x135A1
It is not possible to tell from the glyph which side the speartip is on.
In Unicode 17, the glyph will more clearly show the speartip to be at the top.

0x135A4
The "stick" looks more like a mace in the glyph.

In the photo, the "stick" seems to have a wide bulb at the end. Can an educated guess be made, so
at least description and glyph can become consistent, either by changing description of changing glyph? 
Another solution is to make the description broader, say by writing "holding stick or mace".

0x135A5
Change first full-stop to comma.

ok 0x135B5
Unicode 17 will correct the glyph to have a triangle, consistent with the description,
where the Unicode 16 glyph suggested a cross.

The sign itself is far too small to see this clearly, but one can make an educated guess that the object on the rope
has the same shape as what is depicted in the neighboring iconography.

0x135D3
Correct "holding and axe" to "holding an axe".

0x135D9
The "in front of" makes no sense. The larger man is *behind* the smaller man.

0x135DC
Replace "g[r]ound together" by "bound together". The description of the arms of the second man does not correspond to the glyph. Also, only one knee of the second man is visible in the glyph, whereas the description mentions both knees.
Does the description need to be this precise?

0x135ED
The glyph suggests a uraeus not mentioned in the description. Remove the uraeus from the glyph, or amend the description?

0x135EE
Replace "counterweight (S18) at the counterweight" by just ""counterweight (S18)"

ok 0x135F2
In Unicode 17, the description is corrected from "with counterweight at the counterweight" to "with counterweight".

0x135F4
The glyph suggests a uraeus not mentioned in the description.
The Database refers to p. 215, l. 10 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara015.pdf
<p>
where there is a uraeus.

0x135F9
Replace "counterweight (S18) at the counterweight" by just "counterweight (S18)".

0x13603
Replace "left land" by "left hand".

0x13604
Cannot parse "as a two ties".

0x13605
Is the triangular shape attached to the staff real?
It isn't in Urk I 2,4, and in the photo one cannot even make out the staff:

<p>
If no one can find a reason why the triangular shape should be there, perhaps omit it from the glyph?

0x1360B
Replace "horizontally" by "horizontal" or insert appropriate verb?

0x1360F
"foreleg of the man" cannot be right.

0x13637
Correct "heels touching ties" to "heels touching thighs".
But I would omit this phrase altogether as overly precise (and in similar cases often
inconsistent with the glyph in the code charts).

0x13639
Correct "the the" to "to the".

ok 0x1363E
The glyph lacks a beard.
In Unicode 17, the glyph will have a beard, consistent with the description.
