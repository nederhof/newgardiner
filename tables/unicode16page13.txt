Minor matter but the black blob on the left seems uncharacteristic. May be clockwise / anti-clockwise font-technical issue of an inner curve.

0x141A8
Correct "sting" to "string".

0x141AB
Correct "a the top end" to "at the top end".

0x14153 0x132D3
If you think you can justify having 2 codepoints for these trivial graphical variants, then at the very least you need to have two distinct descriptions.

0x14157 0x132D8
As above.

0x1416B
I cannot match this to the glyph at all. Where is the "an uraeus, with a sun disk on the head"?
The Database points to p. 169 l. 4 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Esna002.pdf
<p>
Apart from the two uraei hanging down, there are no additional uraei,
so I assume the description is wrong.
<p>
It is also easy to misinterpret "two ureai hanging downwards from the horns at either side";
there are examples (at least in iconography) where four uraei in total, two on each side, 
are hanging from the Atef crowns,
see e.g. here:
<p>

0x1416C
I don't see a sun disk on either uraeus in the glyph. The Database points to:
<p>
http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/4209
<p>
The transcription does not have sun disks, while the photo of the heavily eroded inscription could potentially
be interpreted to have sun disks.
There is another token that (in normalized transcription) does have sun disks, namely p. 169 l. 3 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Esna002.pdf
<p>
The main thing is that glyph and description are consistent. Adding sun disks to the
glyph seems the most appropriate way to achieve this.

0x14179
Correct "with sun disks its head" to "with a sun disk on its head".

0x1418E
Huh? What face of a human female? I would need to see an image of what this should look like.
<p>
The Database has "although this form will suffice for Unicode,
in reality the sign from the source is a lot more elaborate".
Then why does the description not describe "this form"? For font designers and encoders alike it creates
unsolvable problems if example glyphs and descriptions are mutually inconsistent.

0x141AF 0x132EF
How are there sickle shapes? To me, 0x132EF and 0x141AF look identical except that one is slightly wider than the other, which is generally not a good enough reason to introduce multiple code points.
<p>
The Encoding Principles have under point 2:
<p>
"Chubby or slender signs are part of this continuum and will not be
differentiated."
TSL has one atypical token TSL_3_20841, and I wonder whether that was the one that was thought to have "sickle shapes":
<p>
https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=5650
<p>
The Database has "Not a meaningful variant". I would agree. Perhaps TSL_3_20841 is just a one-off, clumsily carved instance of the kilt,
rather than an independent shape. But then why was it added?

0x141B6
I count seven fringes in the glyph.

0x141BF 0x141C0 0x132F7
A square is a special case of a rectangle such that the width and height are exactly the same. 
The fringes of 0x141BF and 0x141C0 are comparably long, drawn slightly differently but so what?
It doesn't seem appropriate to me that such shapes would be distinguished in Unicode (cf. again the Encoding Principles).
<p>
The Database says of 0x141BF that it is "[n]ot a meaningful variant of [0x132F7]"; but note that the shape of
0x132F7 in Unicode 16 has sloping fringes, whereas the intended shape in Unicode 5.2 is non-sloping.
I see no reflection in the Database on what the core difference between 0x141BF and 0x141C0 is supposed to be.

0x141D5 0x141D6
If the circle section is to represent a crescent moon, then the glyph doesn't do a very good job 
of representing this, i.e. it is nothing like N11 as it occurs in most fonts.

0x141D7
What is a double crescent moon supposed to look like? Just two circle sections like currently in the glyph?

0x14201
In the glyph, I see a "boss near the top", not in the center.

0x1420D
The fletchings don't seem rounded to me. (But who cares. This is palaeography of the one particular token 
that was found, and is not part of the character identity.)

0x14214 0x14217 0x14216
I see no "loop" in 0x14214, nor in 0x14217.
For 0x14214 the Database refers to:
<p>
http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/4205
<p>
The inscription is rather eroded, but it seems a reasonable guess to interpret the sign as having
a "loop" as in the description, rather than a diagonal beam.
For 0x14217 the Database refers to p. 94, l. 6 of:
<p>
https://archive.org/details/MMAF25/page/n59/mode/2up
<p>
Here the transcription has a "loop" as well instead of the diagonal beam, confirming the description.
<p>
Even before, the Database had for 0x14216: "I am not sure if it is that valuable for Unicode".
After correcting the glyphs of 0x14214 and 0x14217, 
0x14216 becomes basically a duplicate of 0x14214, and there should be even less reason for it to
exist.
