0x14147
Minor matter but the black blob on the left seems uncharacteristic. May be clockwise / anti-clockwise font-technical issue of an inner curve.

If you think you can justify having 2 codepoints for these trivial graphical variants, then at the very least you need to have two distinct descriptions.

0x14157 0x132D8
As above.

0x1416B
I cannot match this to the glyph at all. Where is the "an uraeus, with a sun disk on the head"?

0x1416C
I don't see a sun disk on either uraeus. (Not that I think one should distinguish signs in Unicode on the basis of such tiny details.)

0x14179
Correct "with sun disks its head" to "with a sun disk on its head".

0x1418E
Huh? I see nothing remotely like the description.

0x141AF 0x132EF
How is there a sickle shape? To me, 0x132EF and 0x141AF look identical except that one is slightly wider than the other, which is generally not a good enough reason to introduce multiple code points.
<p>
The Encoding Principles have under point 2:
<p>
"Chubby or slender signs are part of this continuum and will not be
differentiated."
<p>
This seems to suggest that 0x141AF should not have existed next to 0x132EF.

0x141BF 0x141C0
A square is a special case of a rectangle; just saying. The fringes are comparably long, drawn slightly differently but so what?
It doesn't seem appropriate to me that such shapes would be distinguished in Unicode (cf. again the Encoding Principles).

0x141D5 0x141D6
If the circle section is to represent a crescent moon, then the glyph doesn't do a very good of representing this, i.e. it is nothing like N11 as it occurs in most fonts.

0x141D7
What is a double crescent moon supposed to look like? Just two circle sections like currently in the glyph?

0x14214 0x14216
I see no "loop" in 0x14214. If a loop is added, then 0x14214 and 0x14216 become basically the same shape. Not sure how the diagonal part of the standard fits in.
