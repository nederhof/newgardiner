0x1425E
"vertical lines"? I rather see curves, not vertical lines. A matter of loose use of words, or rather an image that is incorrect?

0x1429D 0x1429C
"At the front" in the description of 0x1429D becomes confusing because the sign is mirrored relative to say 0x1429C. Elsewhere in descriptions I have seen use of "left" and "right". I realise the downside of left/right is that strictly speaking this becomes incorrect for right-to-left running text, but the left/right terminology tends to be less ambiguous than front/back when describing signs in the sign list.

0x142AE 0x13349
In the Unicode 5.2 code charts (not the Unicode 16 code charts), the handle of 0x13349 was already a little below the wood.  Either way, distinguishing these two variants on the basis of how many pixels the handle is below the wood is entirely inappropriate for Unicode.

In the Database there is a comment:

"Variation seems meaningless to me. I would not even include it as a class in TSL."
<p>
Quite! How this then became a new code point, let alone a core sign, is a mystery to me.

0x142C4 0x142C5
I suspect the "horizontal line on top of the forked drill-bit" should have distinguished these two, but
it is missing from the glyph of 0x142C5. Without this, the signs are identical for all practical purposes.

0x142DB 0x142DC
To me, "square" implies 4 corners.  If this was meant to contrast 0x142DB with say 0x142DC, then perhaps replace "square-bottomed" by "flat-bottomed"?

0x142F6
The vertical line is interrupted by the base. That seems inconsistent with the description. Is the glyph incorrect or should the description be amended?
<p>
Also, I would replace "coming from" by "on".

0x142F7 0x1334A
Again, is the vertical line in 0x142F7 supposed to be interrupted at the base? There isn't actually a vertical line between the two ovals, it looks more like there is whitespace between the two ovals.
<p>
0x142F7 has "upwards dot"? I would not describe the shape in the glyph as a dot. It looks more like U22 (0x1334A).

0x142FC
There is no discernible beard in the image. Why not omit it from the description if it does not matter?
