0x14231 0x14232
"sun within a halo" suggests there should be an "inner circle". I don't see that in the glyph. (But frankly, who cares about such fiddly details. Something like "sun encircled by a cobra" is precise enough. Or just N6.)

0x14256 0x14253
Is the feather "angled forwards" in the glyph of 0x14256? I thought I understood what descriptions generally mean by "angled forwards" (cf. 0x14253) but this isn't it.

0x1425E
"vertical lines"? I rather see curves, not vertical lines. A matter of loose use of words, or rather a glyph that is incorrect?

0x1425F
Should that be "with weights"? What are the circles at the right?

0x1429D 0x1429C
"At the front" in the description of 0x1429D becomes confusing because the sign is mirrored relative to say 0x1429C. 
(I assume the mirroring is intentional.) 
Elsewhere in descriptions I have seen use of "left" and "right". I realise the downside of left/right is that strictly speaking this becomes incorrect for right-to-left running text, but the left/right terminology tends to be less ambiguous than front/back when describing signs in the sign list.
<p>
Apropos, what I find puzzling in this and many other cases is that only negative views are entered in the Database, here
"variation too limited to be of use for Unicode" and "Not a meaningful variant". And yet it became not only a new code point but
a core sign?

0x142AE 0x13349
In the Unicode 5.2 code charts (not the Unicode 16 code charts), the handle of 0x13349 was already a little below the wood.  Either way, distinguishing these two variants on the basis of how many pixels the handle is below the wood is entirely inappropriate for Unicode.
<p>
In the Database there is a comment:
<p>
"Variation seems meaningless to me. I would not even include it as a class in TSL."
<p>
Quite! How this then became a new code point, let alone a core sign, is a mystery to me.

0x142C4 0x142C5
I suspect the "horizontal line on top of the forked drill-bit" should have distinguished these two, but
it is missing from the glyph of 0x142C5. Without this, the signs are identical for all practical purposes.

0x142C9
The glyph shows a forked drill-bit, not a round drill-bit. The horizontal line is not on top of the drill-bit but over it.

0x142CA
In the glyph, the horizontal line is not on top of the drill-bit but over it.

0x142D0
The glyph has two ticks, not one tick and one loop as in the description.
The Database points to p. 119, l. 13 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/MMAF020.pdf
<p>
This suggests the tick on the right should be redrawn as a small loop, of roughly the same size.

0x142DB 0x142DC
To me, "square" implies 4 corners.  If this was meant to contrast 0x142DB with say 0x142DC, then perhaps replace "square-bottomed" by "flat-bottomed"?

0x142F6
The vertical line is interrupted by the base. That seems inconsistent with the description. Is the glyph incorrect or should the description be amended?
<p>
Also, I would replace "coming from" by "on".

0x142F7 0x1334A
Again, is the vertical line in 0x142F7 supposed to be interrupted at the base? There isn't actually a vertical line between the two ovals, it looks more like there is whitespace between the two ovals.
<p>
0x142F7 has "upwards dot"? I would not describe the shape in the glyph as a dot. It looks more like U22 (0x1334A).

0x142FC
There is no discernible beard in the glyph. Why not omit it from the description if it does not matter?
