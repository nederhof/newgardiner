0x13A66
Only one horn is visible in the glyph. But who cares! How many horns are visible should not matter for the purposes of Unicode.

0x13A6E
There is a beard in the glyph. But who cares whether there is a beard. This should not matter for the purposes of Unicode.

0x13A6C 0x13A6D
There is no beard in the two glyphs. But who cares whether there is a beard. This should not matter for the purposes of Unicode.

0x13A74
No beards are discernable. But who cares! In any case, make sure there are no inconsistencies between descriptions and glyphs. Not
mentioning the beards would be one way to achieve that.

ok 0x13A81
The glyph depicts the jackal over the sedge, not the sedge over the jackal.
The glyph will be corrected in Unicode 17.

ok 0x13A9F 0x13AA0 0x13AA1
In all three glyphs, the *left* paw is raised.
The glyphs will be corrected in Unicode 17.

0x13AA5
In the glyph, it is the left front leg that is raised. But who cares! Changing the description to "one front leg raised" would solve the issue.

0x13ACC 0x13AD8 0x13AE3 0x13B05
In all four glyphs, the blade is not triangular but rounded. But who cares what the shape of the blade is.
I would simply omit "triangular", thereby removing the inconsistencies between descriptions and glyphs.

0x13AAE 0x13AAF
I don't think that the glyph of 13AAE has the head of a jackal. The beak looks more like a falcon (although there are ears). 
Conversely, 13AAF doesn't look like it has the head of a falcon, and I think normally a griffin has the head of a falcon. Are the descriptions reversed?
<p>
The glyph of 0x13AAE does correspond to JSesh E80A and the glyph of 0x13AAF does correspond to JSesh E80, so in 
this respect, UniKemet appears to be accurate.

0x13AB4
The blade in the glyph is toward the front.
The glyph will be "corrected" in Unicode 17.
However, the Database refers to p. 22, l. 11 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/MMAF024.pdf
<p>
where the blade is toward the front. So perhaps it was the description that was wrong after all.
The Database further refers to pl. DCXXXII of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/MMAF031.pdf
<p>
But I cannot make out anything there.
For the purposes of Unicode, encoding the orientation of knives is nonsense anyway, 
and the philologists cannot tell us with certainty which is which,
so at this point I no longer care.

ok 0x13B0E
There are two horizontal strokes in the glyph.
The glyph will be corrected in Unicode 17.

0x13B3B
In the glyph, the top knife has the blade forward.
The glyph will be "corrected" in Unicode 17.
However, after double-checking the link in the Database myself, p. 198, nr. 21 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Esna007.pdf
<p>
I find the glyph was correct after all and the description was wrong.
We are made to change glyphs back and forth based on
conflicting information, and at this point I've had enough.
If it really mattered how many knives there are, where these knives are positioned on the
body of the animal, whether the knives are angled forwards or backwards, 
and on which side the blades are,
then we would have been provided accurate and consistent information from the start.
On the level of Unicode, it never made the slightest sense anyway 
to encode such palaeographic details, and given that after almost a year we've still not converged
should convince anyone by now that we cannot continue in this way.
<p>
All one needs to specify the identity of this sign is something like "Torso of butchered bovid with knives".
Anything more than this serves no reasonable purpose.

ok 0x13B39 0x13B58
To distinguish the two glyphs, the description of 0x13B58 in Unicode 17 will be amended to have "without horns".

ok 0x13AE9
In the glyph, the tail is not folded under the rear.
The glyph will be corrected in Unicode 17.

0x13B0C
For the left baboon, the left/right arms are reversed in the glyph. You could solve this simply by making the description less specific, say "one arm [...] holding [...] and another arm [...]".
<p>
There is a low-resolution photo in the Database, but it is hard to distinguish the left and right arms of the baboon on the left.

0x13B12
I think I understand what is meant (something in the vein of "the kind of
chevaux de frise that typically occurs on top of a wall"), but there are no
walls in the glyphs. I would just omit "on top of walls".

0x13B19
The glyph has a base not mentioned in the description. The existence of the sign with base is confirmed by 
examples listed in the Database.
