The glyph will be corrected in Unicode 17.

ok 0x13A9F 0x13AA0 0x13AA1
In all three glyphs, the *left* paw is raised.
The glyphs will be corrected in Unicode 17.

0x13AAE 0x13AAF
I don't think that the glyph of 13AAE has the head of a jackal. The beak looks more like a falcon (although there are ears). 
Conversely, 13AAF doesn't look like it has the head of a falcon, and I think normally a griffin has the head of a falcon. Are the descriptions reversed?
<p>
The glyph of 0x13AAE does correspond to JSesh E80A and the glyph of 0x13AAF does correspond to JSesh E80, so in 
this respect, Unikemet appears to be accurate.

ok 0x13B39 0x13B58
To distinguish the two glyphs, the description of 0x13B58 in Unicode 17 will be amended to have "without horns".
