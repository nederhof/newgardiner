0x13C9D 0x13C9F
This may be one of the cases where consistency between different fonts will be
impossible to achieve and where it will be impossible for encoders to decide which code point to choose.  The "teardrop sized perch with the point down" *is* an upside down cone. One shape is marginally thinner and longer than the other, that's all.
<p>
The Database writes that the cone in 0x13C9D should be drawn to be small "to distinguish it from" 0x13C9F.
This proves my point. If you need to resort to emphasizing, if not exaggerating, size differences in the normalized font in order
to be able to argue that the two shapes are actually different signs to begin with, then you are just 
inflating the number of code points for the sake of having a lot of code points. The two shapes are functionally equivalent: nb, "lord".
I would challenge anyone to look at the photo of the cited token of 0x13C9D in:

<p>
and the photo of the cited token of 0x13C9F in:
<p>
https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=3557
<p>
and argue that had it not been for the way these two tokens have been transcribed, they would still deem these to be two distinct signs. 

0x13CB4 0x13CB6 0x13CB7
There are no visible cartouches in the glyphs. Copy-and-paste error of description or are the glyphs wrong?
<p>
For 0x13CB6, the Database points to p. 68, l. 8 of:
<p>
https://archive.org/details/MMAF25/page/n45/mode/2up
<p>
If there are cartouches, then they are represented as no more than tiny blobs.
Also, the token looks closer to 0x13CB7 than to 0x13CB6, but with smaller sun.
For 0x13CB7, the Database points to p. 35, l. 10 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara013.pdf
<p>
I don't see cartouches there.

0x13CBA
There are legs in the glyph.
<p>
The Database points to p. 65, l. 8 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Esna007.pdf
<p>
There are definitely legs in the transcription.
The description seems to be wrong.

0x13CBE
The "one wing forward" is not remotely "horizontal" in the glyph. If the glyph is accurate, I would just say "wings forward, one slanting up and the other slanting down", avoiding also mention of the exact angle. [I'm not sure the word "slanting" is the most fluent English word one could choose.]

0x13CC1 0x13CC2
The standards in the glyphs look like one half of the 'sky' sign, not R92A.
<p>
For 0x13CC1, the Database points to p. 282, l. 9 and pl. 166, col. 7 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara010.pdf
<p>
The transcription does seem to suggest that the standard below the falcon looks different from the standards in neighbouring signs.
However, in the photo, the standards look very similar.
<p>
For 0x13CC2, the Database points to p. 372, l. 14 and pl. 234, col. 228 of the same publication.
Here the standard below the falcon looks completely as expected, and suggesting one half of the sky sign is
unwarranted. 
<p>
I would suggest redrawing both glyphs with a normal standard.

0x13CDD
The standard in the glyph is not mentioned in the description.
The Database refers to p. 74, l. 15 of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara014.pdf
<p>
This has a standard as in the glyph.

0x13CD5 0x13CD6 0x13CD9 13CDA
None of the descriptions of human-headed birds mention beards. If these are not expected to have beards, or if it doesn't matter, I would suggest omitting them from the glyphs.
<p>
The glyph of 0x13CDA, unlike 0x13CD9, seems to suggest uraei on the headdress. Are those real?

0x13CE9 0x13CEA 0x13CED 0x13CEE
These violate Point 5 of the Encoding Principles "Signs that exist with and without
inner detailing will be included with the inner detailing".

0x13150 0x13CFC
Introduction of 0x13CFC violates Point 5 of the Encoding Principles.

0x13D10 0x13D11
In the glyph of 0x13D11, the cobra does *not* encircle the sun; it is just the I10 cobra.
Copy-and-paste error from 0x13D10?

0x13D36
In the glyph, the feather is angled backwards, and the spear is angled backwards as well (rather than being vertical).
If you want to call the orientation of the spear "vertical", then fine, but then why specify the orientation of the
feather? The descriptions are overly precise, which creates avoidable problems for consistency.
Another thing is that the glyph does have a "handle" on the arrow/harpoon, contrary to the description.

0x13D45
It is impossible to make out the sun disks on the cobras in the code charts. What's the point of specifying details that are so small that they are lost with any normal resolution?
<p>
(The description is also ungrammatical.)
