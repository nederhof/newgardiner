0x13F8E
One could improve the depiction of the ureaus. 
Currently, one needs some imagination to see a ureaus in the shape.

0x13F93
There is no attempt to specify what the "internal details" consist of. I can understand why, as it would be pretty hard to specify what that even means.  Should any strokes or texture, no matter how insignificant, be seen as "internal detail"? This supports my view that there should not be multiple code points for the same sign with and without "internal details".
Point 5 of the Encoding Principles actually suggests the same.

0x13F98 0x13F99
The two listed functions happen to be different, but unless the two functions are actually tied to the width difference, then this is not a meaningful distinction for Unicode, and consistency between fonts will be impossible to achieve.
<p>
In the Database I see a comment "I am not sure the variation between the O16 variants (broad vs less broad) is meaninful enough to include in Unicode", but also "Seems too numerous to leave out". I understand the first, but the second is moot. I'm sure that you will be able to find lots of occurrences of the flat N025A next to the tall N25 (the "foreign land" sign) in encodings, but that doesn't mean that N25 and N025A have independent character identities. If you believe that N025A (0x1320A) was made Legacy for good reasons (and I would agree), then why should 0x13F98 and 0x13F99 both exist as core signs in Unicode?

0x13FA1 0x13FA2
This distinction is so silly that even the number of vertical lines in the
glyph of 0x13FA1 is wrong (it is four in the glyph, not three).
<p>
Understandably, in the Database we find:
<p>
"I could not verify any token with an glyph, and for Unicode only F2ED7 (O329A) OR F2EDA (O329) should be added, not both."
<p>
Was it a mistake then that both 0x13FA1 and 0x13FA2 ended up being added to Unicode as core signs?

0x13FA3
The glyph and the description don't seem to match. Flat roof? Large doorway?

0x13FA7
I would make the spike more spiky. Now it just looks like a circle.

0x13FCD
In the glyph, I don't see the usual shape of V18.

0x13FD2
I don't see triangles. Redraw needed? What exactly is this supposed to look like? What is the roof like?

0x13FD6 0x13FC1 
The description of 0x13FD6 is not at all what the glyph shows. The glyph has the sky sign where I would expect two abaci (one abacus on top of each column, if I understand what an abacus is). Also, there is not one base, but rather two bases, one under each column.  How I interpret the description of 0x13FD6 is as 0x13FC1 but without the carrying chair.

0x13FD7
I would simplify "on top of a base (O210A); on a broad base" to "on top of a broad base (O210A)". Unless I misunderstand what is meant.
<p>
The abaci are not shown in the glyph. (Why bother mentioning the abaci in the
first place? It is a tiny detail and likely not essential to the character identity.)

0x13FEB
Truncated description.

0x13FF2
The Database says "Needs to be atomic due to the position of the O34."
<p>
Nonsense, because (1) whether O34 is 1pt higher or lower relative to the legs is paleography, and (2) it is the font's responsibility to arrange signs in a suitable manner. This exact group was in fact listed in:
<p>
https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax/ligaturelist.html
<p>
And here linked to insertions:
<p>
https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax/insertionlist.html
<p>
If we are starting to encode groups atomically because we wish to fine-tune their exact positioning, then why did we bother with controls in the first place? Controls by definition abstract away from exact positionings. The advantages of controls are normalization and abstraction.  Are we willing to give up on these advantages now?  It makes no sense to on the one hand deprecate clearly distinct graphical variants in the basic list (making them Legacy), motivated by the advantages of normalization and abstraction, while on the other hand introducing new atomic encodings of compositional groups, moving away from normalization.
<p>
And if you accept that Unicode needs to encode fine-tuned positioning, then the one or two ligatures that have slipped through in the extended Unicode set will not suffice. You will need to start introducing possibly hundreds of additional code points of compositional groups. I don't think anyone would be happy with that either.

0x13FFF 0x1329A
Introduction of 0x13FFF violates Point 5 of the Encoding Principles:
<p>
"Signs that exist with and without inner detailing will be included with the inner detailing".

0x14006 0x14007
Hm, I think I understand what is meant (something in the vein of "the kind of
chevaux de frise that typically occurs on top of a wall"), but there are no
walls in the glyphs. I would just omit "on top of walls".

0x1400C
I would make the spike more spiky because currently it doesn't look like a spike.

0x13294 0x14010 0x14011 0x14012
If it is really necessary to distinguish these, then in 0x13294 and 0x14010, at least specify *two* angled lines. Perhaps for 0x14011 one could replace "multiple" by "more than 4".

0x14014
The glyph doesn't correspond well to the description. Consider the bottom horizontal line in the middle, which is too high.

0x14027 0x14028
Why is this not the same sign (with two different but related functions)?
<p>
The Database has "Meaningless variant". Well then?

0x14032
In the glyph there are *two* oars/rudders at the back.
