ok 0x13043
Originally, there was a line representing the ground, and there was no connecting rope. 
Now there is no line for the ground and there is a rope connecting the two pieces of the hoe. 
In this instance, the Database seems to offer adequate justification for a change to a glyph. 
Both Urk IV 57,3, supposedly the source of the sign according to Gardiner (1928), and the earlier publication by Bouriant it was based on
(in Recueil de traveaux 12, 1890) have the Unicode 16 form. For the latter, see p. 107 of:
<p>
https://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/rectrav1892/0117/image,info

0x13008
The Database has "I am rather doubtful if this grapheme actually exists"  
but fails to address the link in the original UniKemet from 2006 to GITB 804-005-650
where the exact Unicode 5.2 glyph is found, with feet that are vertical rather than horizontal:
<p>
http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/8rel100.pdf
<p>
Either way, no justification was offered for the change of the position of the feet; see also above for 0x13007.
One would have to have very good arguments not to revert to the Unicode 5.2 form.

0x1300A
There are two differences, the orientation of the hands, and the orientation of the feet.
<p>
As for the hands, the Database has a comment "IT IS A FISTED HAND, not a handpalm oriented inwardly", which
already contradicts the description. In the TSL:
<p>
https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=895
<p>
there are at least two occurrences where the hand palm (not a fist) to me appears to be very clearly oriented outwards:
namely TSL_3_22086 and TSL_3_17746. Some other tokens are not clear enough to be sure.
<p>
As for the feet, the Database does not even mention that there was a change relative to Unicode 5.2.
Again, many examples in the TSL seem to suggest the feet are vertical rather than horizontal,
including at least TSL_3_14385, TSL_3_17746, TSL_3_23102, TSL_3_25540. In other words, the
Unicode 5.2 form appears to be reasonably representative,
and one would need very good arguments not to revert to the Unicode 5.2 form.
<p>
One could perhaps omit specification of the orientation of the hand in the description, 
and one may avoid clearly depicting the orientation of the hand in the glyph, thereby not committing to one view or another.

ok 0x13023
The orientation of the hands differs.
The Database does not address, let alone justify, the change.
The tokens in the TSL are not clear enough to tell:
<p>
https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=492
<p>
This said, I cannot tell from the printed form in GEG either what the orientation of the hands is.
Everything else being equal, the usual reading as classifier "turning away" seems to favour
the orientation of the hands as in Unicode 16, and there may not be a compelling reason to revert to Unicode 5.2.

0x1304F 0x137E9 0x137EA
The hands of 0x1304F were oriented outwards, now inwards. 
The supposed source is GITB 801-626-810, but this does not have the sign:
<p>
http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/s14.pdf
<p>
This makes it hard to confirm the orientation of the hands.
A similar sign is:
<p>
https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=883
<p>
but there the hands are oriented inwards, provided the blurry photos are interpreted correctly.
Another occurrence is on p. 134, l. 14 and pl. DCCCLXXXIV of:
<p>
https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara009.pdf
<p>
The transcription has the hands inward, but the photo is again too blurry to be sure about the orientation of the hands.
<p>
Now, one could argue that the orientation of the hands is not important, and so we can simply
replace the old glyph by the new glyph.
However, the orientation of the hands was apparantly important enough to distinguish
0x137E9 and 0x137EA and give them separate code points. (All these signs seem to be functionally 
indistinguishable: ḥḥ, "million".)
So what is it? Is the orientation of the hands important, or is it not important?

0x13057 0x136D7 0x136D9
For 0x13057, there was a uraeus in the original, now there is not. 
The Database motivates this by asserting that the uraeus was a mistake 
because it is not in Gardiner's source (Ann 42, 479). However, the font used
therein is extremely coarse:
<p>
https://archive.org/details/ASAE-42-1943/page/n251/mode/2up
<p>
My hunch is that if the uraeus had existed, it would not have been visible in the transcription anyway.
<p>
Considering 0x136D7 and 0x136D9, which do have uraei, is it not plausible that the original shape might have existed? If so far no token of 0x13057 was located with uraeus, then what if such a token will eventually be found? Will a new code point be introduced for it? 
This is disastrous for the stability of Unicode.
Would it not have been safer to introduce a new code point for the shape without uraeus? 
It is not like new code points were used sparingly; a staggering number of new code points were introduced for
barely distinguishable variants of the heron alone.

0x1306F 0x1375D
For 0x1306F, the sun-disk was removed. This is fine if the sun-disk in the original shape seems to have been due to a misinterpretation of known tokens. But note that there are headdresses in similar signs like 0x1375D with sun-disk.
<p>
In the Database I find "redraw of C18G without sun" but without justification.

0x130E8
The Unicode 5.2 form did not have the uraeus. 
The Database justifies adding the uraeus by the observation that many occurrences have a uraeus, calling
this "correcting" of the glyph. I don't think the word "correcting" is appropriate if occurrences 
without uraeus exist, and then the glyph without uraeus would not be incorrect per se.
Nonetheless this change to the glyph may cause relatively little disruption, provided no one will now consider 
introducing a new code point for the original form without uraeus.
<p>
This identifies a major shortcoming of the kEH_Desc descriptions: a description describes a single 'representative' token that 
the philologists happened to find, down to minute detail. The new UniKemet also typically lists only the one function of that
one token.
But this fails to capture the type. For example,
if in the future the intention is that 0x130E8 can be used for the sign with uraeus and the sign without uraeus,
then currently no documentation exists that expresses this intention. In this sense, this is a step back from the documentation in GEG, 
which, by being less overspecific about appearance of signs, made it clear to encoders 
that signs could be used for a range of graphical variants.

0x130F3
Unicode 5.2 form did not have the four pieces of grain or fruit. This seems an insignificant detail and 
I have no objection to the embellishment of the glyph with the four pieces of grain or fruit. I think though that one should simplify
the description to just mention that there is a basket, without (over)specifying what is in it.

0x13146 0x13C7C
It is unclear to me what kind of standard was intended with the original shape of 0x13146, and it seems an insignificant detail. But if one starts introducing multiple code points depending on the choice of standard (cf. 0x13C7C), then it is not clear to me that the change of shape of 0x13146 is within the normal bounds of allowable graphical variation for a given code point, and perhaps a fresh code point would have been warranted.
<p>
The Database does not contain a shred of reflection on the fact that the shape of 0x13146 has changed.

0x1314B
The head of antelope was not previously discernible.
If I correctly interpret the very fuzzy images in the TSL:
<p>
https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=3196
<p>
then the sign may occur with and without head of antelope.
Nonetheless, it would have been nice to see some acknowledgement in the Database that the glyph has changed.
Again, there is the problem that the description specifies the token, not the type.
<p>
Are *two* rudders visible, in both glyphs? In that case the description and the glyph are inconsistent.

0x1314F 0x137B8
For 0x1314F, the sun-disk was removed. This is fine if the sun-disk in the original shape seems to have been due to a misinterpretation of known tokens. But note that there are headdresses in similar signs like 0x137B8 that do have a sun-disk.
<p>
The Database does not contain a shred of reflection on the fact that the shape of 0x1314F has changed.
It does comment that "Jsesh glyph has a circle in crown".
What evidence justified departing from both the original Unicode 5.2 shape and the JSesh shape?
If no such evidence exists, then one should have kept the original shape, rather than sacrifice the stability
of Unicode on a whim for no apparent reason.

0x13233
Child was given white crown. Bovid lost its horns.
<p>
The Database says no token could be found. The default action should then be to keep the shape as it is, rather than
change the glyph randomly, and sacrifice the stability of Unicode on a whim for no apparent reason.

0x13234
Child was given white crown.
<p>
The Database says no token could be found. The default action should then be to keep the shape as it is, rather than
change the glyph randomly, and sacrifice the stability of Unicode on a whim for no apparent reason.

0x13235
Headdress lost the sun-disk.
<p>
The Database says "Could not yet locate an example." There cannot therefore have been a justification for changing the shape.

0x1323B
In the original, the feather was not angled backwards.
I'm not concerned about the glyph, but the description seems overspecific, unless you can make
a case that the angle of the feather is an integral element of the character identity that
Gardiner overlooked.

0x13236
The bow was mirrored.
The Database aims to motivate the change on the basis of available tokens, but I'm far from convinced.
It says "I wonder if the bow is ever facing outwards". Roughly the same group above
the standard (but without standard) is at the extreme right in the photo of:
<p>
http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1128
<p>
Here the bow is outward, seemingly contradicting the above. 
Just because one could not find an attestation of the exact Unicode 5.2 glyph within the available time, 
that doesn't mean the glyph was wrong and that there was a compelling reason to change it.

ok 0x1323C
The object on the standard changed from looking similar to Y8 to something closer to R028.
As the Database points out, the Unicode 5.2 form differs from what, according to the original UniKemet, should have been
the source, namely Gardiner (1953). See p. 52 of:
<p>
https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2005/05313-Gardiner28-57.pdf
<p>
It is hard to escape the conclusion that the shape was incorrectly copied from Gardiner (1953) to the Unicode 5.2 code charts at the time.
The Unicode 16 shape therefore seems to be an improvement.

0x1324E
I would not be concerned about the slight change to the glyph, 
if it were not for UniKemet descriptions elsewhere
that explicitly specify whether a knife has a triangular or a rounded blade.
If it is felt to be important whether a knife has a triangular or a rounded blade, 
then I would not expect for the shape of a blade in the code charts to
arbitrarily change, especially if the Database says "Could not yet locate a token".

0x13332
The original shape did not have a boss. Here it seems acceptable, though far from necessary, to refine the appearance, since
Gardiner refers to an occurrence at Medinet Habu where the sign appears to have a boss;
see Plate 45, column 37 of:
<p>
https://isac.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/shared/docs/oip8.pdf
<p>
But "in the center" in the description is not accurate. I would write "near the top of the shield".

0x13241
In the original, the standard was simplified.
In the Database, I see no reflection on this. The Database has a reference to:
<p>
http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1202
<p>
which has yet another form of the standard,
with diagonal bar rather than "a loop under the horizontal beam, running over the vertical pole".
It would be fine to normalize glyphs when it comes to the type of standard, and to use a default form of R12 for any signs with
a standard that is similar to R12. But this is not what was done elsewhere, especially for the extended list. 
There appears to have been no consistent strategy for the treatment of standards.

0x13242
In the original, the standard was simplified.
The Database has "Transcription only. Inclusion in core based on principle, not verification with image".
How then can a change to the glyph be justified?

0x13246
The standards are different, although both standards are often referred to as instances of R12.
Also, in the original, the hare had whiskers.
<p>
The Database lists both the original shape and the new shape, in different entries, without acknowledging
that the standard in 0x13246 changed between Unicode 5.2 and Unicode 16. According to the Database the two forms are
"practically identical". I don't necessarily disagree with this, but if the two forms are practically identical,
then why was a change needed in the first place? Because an attestation
could be found for one form and not for the other? Will the shape of 0x13246 change back once the original form is attested?
<p>
I detect an eagerness to change glyphs in the code charts for the sake of making changes, not because there is any
compelling need. To destroy and remake in one's image is not in the interests of the user community.
<p>
By the way, there is a token where the standard is somewhere in between the standards above. See 9th column from the left in the photo of:
<p>
http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1128

0x13247
There was no basket in the original shape. 
As the Database points out, the Unicode 5.2 form differs from what, according to the original UniKemet, should have been
the source, namely Gardiner (1953). See p. 52 of:
<p>
https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2005/05313-Gardiner28-57.pdf
<p>
It is hard to escape the conclusion that the shape was incorrectly copied from Gardiner (1953) to the Unicode 5.2 code charts at the time.
The Unicode 16 shape therefore seems to be an improvement.
<p>
However, the "four pieces of grain or fruit" seem overly specific and can
certainly not be discerned in Gardiner (1953). I would omit this phrase from the description.

0x1324F
The object on the standard changed to a kind of overlay. 
The Database notes that a supposed token of this sign has been identified that has "X1 behind what looks like a U8".
This could be in the second column in the photo of:
<p>
http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1128
<p>
where X1 is to the left of what looks like U8, so "behind" in terms of reading order.
(See also the first column, where there is the same combination of X1 and what looks like U8, but without standard.)
I suspect the new glyph for Unicode 16 was created with the misunderstanding that "behind" meant "overlay".
<p>
Assuming that the above text correctly identifies the sign that Gardiner had in mind (which is not at all clear to me), 
then a redrawing of the glyph may be in order. In any case, it should not be an overlay.

0x1327F
The original shape was asymmetric, while the new shape is perfectly symmetric. Can that be correct? I imagine a tenoned door not to be symmetric.

0x1328F
There was no loop at the front in the original.
I don't think anyone cares that the glyph is refined. The only suggestion I have is to omit the loop from the description as
overly precise.

0x132BA
The two shapes are similar. But I cannot relate the description to the shapes. 
I don't think the tie towards the front should be drawn as one with the outline of the bag.
What is the "loop at the back"? May the description be overly precise?

0x132BF
The standard has a different shape.
The Database does not contain a shred of reflection on the fact that the shape has changed.

0x132C5
The headdress lost the sun disk. The Database motivates this by "more often without disk".
I don't think anyone cares about the change to the glyph. But by the same token, I don't think
there was ever a compelling need for any change.

0x132F7 0x141BF 0x141C0
In the original shape of 0x132F7, the fringes were not sloping.
<p>
Erman and Grapow already listed and contrasted both the non-sloping and the sloping forms (the latter with cross). 
The vast majority of dictionaries and grammars use the non-sloping form of S32. 
One would have to have very good arguments to unceremoniously purge the traditionally used
non-sloping form by replacing it with the sloping form.
<p>
I also don't see how one can argue that 0x141BF and 0x141C0 deserve two independent (core) code points, even though they are basically the same shape apart from aspect ratio of the crossed rectangle, 
while at the same time treating the non-sloping and sloping forms of S32 as the same shape to justify arbitrarily
replacing one by the other in the code charts.
<p>
The Database does not contain a shred of reflection on the fact that the shape has changed.

0x130B9
It is debatable whether the original shape has the folded piece of cloth on top, or whether the intention was to underspecify which of the two signs is on top. In the latter case, it may be adequate to describe this simply as an overlay of the two signs without specifying which of the two is on top, and leave it to the font designer how to draw this. By the same reasoning, 
the current glyph in Unicode 16 can also remain as it is, as one allowable graphical realization of the underlying sign.
<p>
There are several more such cases below.

0x13138
As above.

0x13155
As above.

0x13156
As above.

0x13174
As above.

0x13175
As above.

0x131AE
As above.

0x131B2
As above.

0x13266
As above.

0x132A3
As above.

0x132E1
As above.

0x13353
As above.

0x1325F
The original shape underspecified which of the signs is on top. The new shape specifies that it is the column that is on top.
I have no objection to the new shape, but
I would prefer for the description to leave underspecified which sign is on top, as it is not clear from the original shape either.

0x1342D
In general, with how much detail a sign is represented is unimportant, as long as the sign is recognized.
But, first, the extended list often introduced multiple code points 
for signs with and without internal details. So apparently, in those cases internal details were important enough to warrant multiple
code points. But internal details were apparently so unimportant that it was fine to
unceremoniously purge them from 0x1342D, a well-known sign that appears with these internal details
in almost every printed and digital sign list. At the very least, this lacks consistency.
<p>
Second, just because within the available time no token of Aa31 could be identified with visible diagonal strokes,
that does not mean that no such tokens exist. 
Moreover, a sign list is not a list of tokens, it is a list of types.
A type (sign) is an abstraction of potentially many tokens, rather than a facsimile of one particular token,
and could have more or fewer graphical features than any particular known token.
<p>
Third, it is underappreciated that the main purpose of a glyph in a normalized font is to communicate the identity
of a sign to the reader. Everyone would immediately recognize the form with the internal details as Aa31, as it appears like that
in almost every printed and digital sign list. 
Even the normalized font of the TSL displays Aa31 with internal details.
Leaving out the internal details from Aa31 in Unicode fonts will cause unnecessary confusion to users.
I'm also reminded of Point 5 of the Encoding Principles:
<p>
https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr57/tr57-4.html#EncodingPrinciples
<p>
which has "inner detailing [...] helps in avoiding confusion". This is one of the Encoding Principles that makes sense.
<p>
I don't see any downsides to keeping the internal details either.
The devil's advocate would say that a student would be misled into thinking that
any token of Aa31 in a real inscription must have all the internal details
that the normalized glyph has. But even a beginning student would know that this is not how the writing system works.
<p>
It appears that the unannounced revision of the basic sign list that no one asked for
was guided by an eagerness to destroy and remake in one's image,
from the perspective of palaeographic special interests,
rather than by any considerations about the
continuity of Unicode or what would be best for typical users.
