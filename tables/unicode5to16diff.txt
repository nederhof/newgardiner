0x13043 0x1333C
In 0x13043, there was a line representing the ground, and there was no connecting rope. Now there is no line for the ground and there is a rope connecting the two pieces of the hoe. There may be good reasons to update the glyph, provided one can argue that the original form was incorrect. But there is a sign 0x1333C for a hoe without connecting rope, so the original glyph of 0x13043 is not implausible. If so far no token of 0x13043 was located without connecting rope, then what are you going to do if you do find such a token, introduce a new code point for it? This is disastrous for the stability of Unicode.

0x1304F
Hands were oriented outward, now inward. This may be a legitimate improvement since it has been argued that the shape with outward handpalms was plain wrong and does not occur in real inscriptions.

0x13055
In the original shape, the hair is not long.

0x13057 0x136D7 0x136D9
For 0x13057, there was a uraeus in the original, now there is not. There may be good reasons to update the glyph of 0x13057, provided one can argue the original shape was incorrect. But considering 0x136D7 and 0x136D9, which do have uraei, is it not plausible that the original shape might exist? If so far no token of 0x13057 was located with uraeus, then what are you going to do if you do find such a token, introduce a new code point for it? This is disastrous for the stability of Unicode.

0x1306F 0x1375D
For 0x1306F, the sun-disk was removed. This is fine if the sun-disk in the original shape seems to have been due to a misinterpretation of known tokens. But note that there are headdresses in similar signs like 0x1375D with sun-disk.

0x130B9
It is debatable whether the original shape has the folded piece of cloth on top, or whether the intention was to underspecify which of the two signs is on top. In the latter case, it may be adequate to describe this simply as an overlay of the two signs without specifying which of the two is on top, and leave it to the font designer how to draw this. There are several more such cases.

0x130E8
The Unicode 5.2 form did not have the uraeus. If the missing uraeus was clearly a mistake, then fine. But if there is a reasonable chance one could also find occurrences without uraeus, will you then introduce a new code point for this once this happens? This is disastrous for the stability of Unicode.

0x130F3
Unicode 5.2 form did not have the four pieces of grain or fruit. Seems insignificant detail and one could just mention in the description that there is a basket without specifying what is in it.

0x13146 0x13C7C
It is unclear to me what kind of standard was intended with the original shape of 0x13146, and it seems an insignificant detail. But if one starts introducing multiple code points depending on the choice of standard (cf. 0x13C7C), then it is not clear to me that the change of shape of 0x13146 is within the normal bounds of allowable graphical variation for a given code point, and perhaps a fresh code point would have been warranted.

0x1314B
The head of antelope was not previously discernible. Are *two* rudders visible, in both glyphs?

0x1314F 0x137B8
For 0x1314F, the sun-disk was removed. This is fine if the sun-disk in the original shape seems to have been due to a misinterpretation of known tokens. But note that there are headdresses in similar signs like 0x137B8 that do have a sun-disk.

0x13233
Child was given white crown. Bovid lost its horns.

0x13234
Child was given white crown.

0x13235
Headdress lost the sun-disk.

0x13236
The bow was mirrored.

0x1323C
The object on the standard changed from looking similar to Y8 to something closer to R28.

0x13241
In the original, the standard was simplified.

0x13242
In the original, the standard was simplified.

0x13247
There was no basket in the original shape. I understand the information in the Database to suggest this sign also occurs without basket. It might therefore have been better to keep the sign unchanged, as the original form is not objectively wrong.

0x1324F
Object on standard changed to a kind of overlay.

0x1325F
The original shape underspecified which of the signs is on top. It seems fine to me to clarify the desired appearance as is done here.

0x1327F
The original shape was asymmetric, while the new shape is perfectly symmetric. Can that be correct? I imagine a tenoned door not to be symmetric.

0x1328F
There was no loop at the front in the original.

0x132BA
The two shapes are similar. But I cannot relate the description to the shapes. What is the loop at the back?

0x132BF
The standard has a different shape.

0x132C5
There appears to be a sun-disk on the headdress in the original.

0x132E1
The original shape underspecified which of the signs is on top. It seems fine to me to clarify the desired appearance as is done here. One worry for this case and for related cases is this: if the description mentioning which sign is on top is based on just one occurrence, and if in fact both possibilities exist, then the description is unduly specific. It would then be better to simply say that this is an overlay without specifying which sign is on top.

0x132F7 0x141BF 0x141C0
In the original shape of 0x132F7, the fringes were not sloping.
<p>
Erman and Grapow already listed and contrasted both the sloping and the non-sloping forms. Many, if not most, dictionaries and grammars use the
non-sloping form of S32. One would have to have very good arguments to unceremoniously purge the traditionally used
non-sloping form by replacing it with the sloping form.
<p>
I also don't see how you can argue that 0x141BF and 0x141C0 deserve two independent (core) code points, even though they are basically the same shape apart from aspect ratio, while at the same time treating the non-sloping and sloping forms of S32 as the same shape to justify arbitrarily
replacing one by the other in the code charts.
