0x1396B
If the knife is *over* the strand, then let the knife occlude view of part of the strand to avoid inconsistency between
description and glyph.

0x1396D 0x13970
Is it plausible that these are truly distinct signs, in the sense that if the strands are one pixel further to the left or to
the right, then the function changes?
Do these really need to be distinguished in Unicode? The Database does not reflect on this at all.

0x13982
I'm not sure that the line of eye-paint in the glyph can be called "wavy". Nor am I sure anyone should care, apart from
hard-core palaeographers. Omit "wavy" from the description?

ok 0x13989 0x1398A 0x1398B
In Unicode 17, the V-shaped patterns in 0x1398A and 0x1398B will be corrected to be triangles like in 0x13989, 
consistent with the descriptions.

0x130AB 0x139FE 0x139FF
Treating 0x139FE and 0x139FF as distinct from 0x130AB strays well into the realm of
palaeography, which is normally considered to be outside the scope of Unicode.
The Database mentions for both 0x139FE and 0x139FF "Exists, but would already be covered by [...] 0x130AB", but offers
no further justification why these two became core signs nonetheless.
<p>
For 0x139FF in particular, it seems hard to defend the length of the thumb as a reason to introduce a new code point.
For 0x139FE, I don't really consider the thumb to be "upward" any more than in 0x130AB; one slightly more obvious
graphical difference is that the egg is held at an angle in 0x139FE, but the description does not
mention the angle of the egg as significant.
It would be hard to argue moreover that the hieroglyphic depiction of an "egg" and an "oval" are distinct.
Functionally, the signs are equivalent.

0x13A01 0x13A02
Again, it would be hard to argue that the distinction between these two is anything other than palaeographic.

ok 0x13A13
In the glyph, the angle is not exactly 90°. In Unicode 17, the description will be adjusted to have "roughly 90°".

ok 0x13A20
The glyph may be misunderstood as an overlay of "hills" N26 and "leg" D58. 
In Unicode 17, the glyph will be drawn differently to bring out U28 more clearly.

ok 0x13A2A
In the glyph, the vertical part of the standard looks like a leg of an animal, and there appears to be a loop at the right. 
Both were confirmed to be errors. In Unicode 17, the glyph will be corrected to have a plain standard with a diagonal beam.

0x13A5C
The loop around the neck in the glyph is an error. In Unicode 17, this will be removed.
The description has "four pieces" while the glyph has three. A clear case of an overly specific
description leading to avoidable problems. I suggesting omitting (at least) "four pieces of" in the description;
"a basket with grain or fruit" is specific enough.

0x139B2
Does it taper out towards the top as well? The glyph suggests it mainly tapers out towards the top in fact. Not sure we should care about the exact shape. The main issue is that the shape is an oar, or more precisely, the blade of an oar (I think).

0x139BA
I'm not sure how to interpret "blade upwards". My first hunch would be to interpret it differently from the glyph,
namely having the blade on top. Why not omit "blade upwards" to avoid the issue?
<p>
The Database has a tiny photo, which I interpret more like the description than like the glyph. 

0x139C3 0x139C9 0x139CA
For all three glyphs, I'm not sure how to see a "loop" in the shapes.  Are the glyphs accurate?
For 0x139C9 I'm also not sure how to interpret "angled forwards".
