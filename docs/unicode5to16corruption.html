  <body><h1>Corruption of the basic sign list of Egyptian hieroglyphs in Unicode 16</h1>

<h2>Unicode 5.2</h2>

In preparation for the list of Egyptian hieroglyphs in Unicode 5.2 (released in 2009),
a database called UniKemet was created, published in 2006 as pp. 33-51 of:
<p>
<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06354-n3181-egyptian.pdf">https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06354-n3181-egyptian.pdf</a>
</p><p>
This database rigorously linked the relevant hieroglyphs
either to publications from the Griffith Institute or to the Hieratische Paläographie of Georg Möller.
Note that each row lists the exact source as well as the exact location within the source.
The sources from the Griffith Institute include Gardiner's grammar, and a number of ancillary documents, which were made
publicly available:
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2005/05313-Gardiner28-57.pdf">https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2005/05313-Gardiner28-57.pdf</a>
</p>
Gardiner's grammar provides extensive information about the signs, together with bibliographic references, 
and also the ancillary documents provide,
albeit to varying degrees, information about many additional signs. Some signs are linked to
particular inscriptions listed in the Griffith Institute Topographical Bibliography (GITB), which allows
these signs to be studied in context.
<p>
The signs were given Unicode names that were similar to the names used by Gardiner. However, all numbers were padded
with zeros to make 3-digit numbers; for example, Gardiner's A1 became A001. 
One rationale was to avoid any clash with sign names used by disparate
sign lists, such as various editions of the Manuel de Codage and Hieroglyphica, and the sign list of the JSesh hieroglyphic editor.
A related rationale was to avoid any suggestion that the Unicode signs stood for anything 
other than the signs from the publications of Gardiner and Möller, and in case of doubt about appearance or function,
one would have to rely primarily on these publications as opposed to any others.

</p><h2>Unicode 16</h2>

For the development of the extended sign list of Unicode 16, two databases were used,
one of which happens to be also named UniKemet:
<p>
<a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/Unikemet.txt">https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/Unikemet.txt</a>
</p><p>
and the other will be referred to henceforth as the Database:
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2023/23109-n5215-database.pdf">https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2023/23109-n5215-database.pdf</a>
</p><p>
Surprisingly however, none of the information from the original UniKemet was included, 
and it is unclear whether the recent work was done with any awareness that that earlier database 
rigorously tied code points to sources.
On the contrary, it seems the glyphs in the code charts were taken
as mere suggestions, and new signs were arbitrarily assigned to old code points while old signs moved to new code points.
</p><p>
This has thrown the user community into turmoil. Encodings produced in the past 15 years may no longer be 
valid, as old code points now stand for different signs, and the intended signs have moved to different code points. 
Hieroglyphic fonts created in the past 15 years are now inconsistent with the current code charts and recalling and updating all those 
fonts would be impossible.
</p><p>
Although in some instances the changes are harmless and do not require any fixes, there are many other cases where
code points were given entirely different identities, without any justification whatsoever in the Database.
In order to limit the harm, those code points need to be restored to their original intentions as soon as possible,
ideally in Unicode 17, so that the corruption can remain limited to only one Unicode release.
</p><p>
Listed below are all discrepancies between Unicode 5.2 and Unicode 16 that I have been able to identify,
divided into apparent errors and other noteworthy differences. 
I'm also listing cases where the Unicode 16 glyph is correct but the UniKemet documentation is inaccurate.
Where two glyphs are given for the same code point, the first is from Unicode 5.2 and the second is from Unicode 16. The glyphs were automatically extracted from the official PDF code charts. Lines in blue starting with code point and kEH_Desc are descriptions copied verbatim from 
UniKemet. Comments in green indicate that the issues were resolved.

But note that then U+13017 and U+134CD will differ by no more than the exact degree of the angle, which seems an inappropriately small graphical distinction for the purposes of Unicode.</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/77882.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/77882.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">1303A</div></td><td><img src="glyphs16/79197.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">1355D</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+1303A kEH_Desc Man, seated, both knees up, with covered legs and arms, with a short bushy beard and long wig, holding a stick which angles slightly towards the body.</tt><br/><tt>U+1355D kEH_Desc Man, seated, both knees up, with covered legs and arms, with a short bushy beard and short hair/wig, holding a stick which angles slightly towards the body.</tt></p><p class="done">Considering the hairstyles, U+1303A was misplaced at U+1355D.

The Database has
"Nederhof example is a different sign though [...]". Different from what? Also, it is not my example, it is *the* example that was *the*
justification for introducing this code point in Unicode 5.2 in the first place.
The only ground truth in determining what a code point should stand for is the original UniKemet database 
used to compile the Unicode 5.2 basic list. See p. 34 of:</p><p><a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06354-n3181-egyptian.pdf">https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06354-n3181-egyptian.pdf</a></p><p>It defines B005A as the sign in GITB 804-013-500:</p><p><a href="http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/8rel100.pdf">http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/8rel100.pdf</a></p><p>In the transcription the hair is definitely not long. Unless one argues that the mentioned tomb relief was misread,
and no one has argued that so far, the hair should be short in the code charts.
In fact, the Database confirms that the sign in Page-Gasser &amp; Wiese (1997)
has "short hair". One could argue that "no female features" might be a reason to adjust the glyph with regard to the original, 
but since there is no doubt the sign represents a female, who cares to what extent the "female features" are accentuated in the glyph.</p><p>To be clear, I suspect the length of the hair is not part of the character identity, in which case
the description could omit mention of the length of the hair and leave it to the font to decide. 
But if the Database now argues there are two different signs,
then the question which of those two signs is the one that is represented by U+13055 is unambiguously answered by the
original UniKemet database.</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/77911.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/77911.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">13057</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+13057 kEH_Desc Woman, seated, both knees up, with covered legs and arms, with long hair, wearing a diadem, holding a flower which curves forward, with the flower orientated downwards.</tt></p><p>For U+13057, there was a uraeus in the original, now there is not. 
The Database motivates this by asserting that the uraeus was a mistake 
because it is not in Gardiner's source (Ann 42, 479), from the tomb of Kheruef. However, 
the reason why no uraeus is visible in that publication is simply because the font used
therein is too coarse to see such details:</p><p><a href="https://archive.org/details/ASAE-42-1943/page/n251/mode/2up">https://archive.org/details/ASAE-42-1943/page/n251/mode/2up</a></p><p>If we look at the corresponding facsimile in Plate 56 of the following publication we do see the uraeus:</p><p><a href="https://isac.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/shared/docs/oip102.pdf">https://isac.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/shared/docs/oip102.pdf</a></p><p>This sign in the cartouche of queen Tiye consistently has the uraeus in that same tomb.
See also Plates 9, 10, 24, 26, 42, 49, 51, 57, 66.
So the Database is incorrect where it says "Gardiner added an uraeus, the token his sign is based on 
(which is the one encoded in TSL) does not actually have the uraeus, so the addition is erronious to begin with".
The uraeus wasn't added by Gardiner, it has always been there.
As to the TSL:</p><p><a href="https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=1197">https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=1197</a></p><p>I find one token for queen Tiye (TSL_3_22183), but it is not the one that Gardiner refers to,
and with the blurry photo of this eroded inscription, one can debate whether traces of a uraeus might be visible.
It appears to be a classical case of confirmation bias to take a single token for queen Tiye,
after overlooking a dozen others, classify and transcribe it in the TSL 
as not having a uraeus because one cannot make out a uraeus in that single photo, and then to refer to the TSL as
evidence that the sign does not have a uraeus.</p><p>Especially when it comes to glyphs that have already been used for 15 years or more in 
encodings, fonts, tools, databases, and teaching materials, and where severe disruption is caused by any changes,
the bar should be far higher. There should be more thorough analysis, documentation and justification. And above all,
there should be more transparency. The default should be to leave things as they are unless there are clearly articulated 
and convincing reasons to make changes.</p><p>The uraeus suggests royalty (personal communication wth Peter Dils), and so the change
of the glyph affected an important clue to the interpretation of the sign (Gardiner has "Det. of names of queens").</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/78017.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/78017.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">130C1</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+130C1 kEH_Desc A forearm, with the palm of the hand facing upwards (D36) written over a human foot and lower leg (D58).</tt></p><p>These are arguably only insignificant graphical variants of the same thing, but unless one can argue that one variant is real and the other variant is not real (never occurs), one should revert to the original Unicode 5.2 variant, and change description and image accordingly. Incidentally, both forms exist in GEG, and are in fact found in the same line (top line of p. 458). 
In 2005-2009, there were discussions about which of the two was the most appropriate form for Unicode, and in consultation with Egyptologists it was decided to opt for the form in Unicode 5.2. Whether or not one agrees now this was the right decision at the time
should be irrelevant. Code charts should not be changed without a compelling reason.</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/78078.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/78078.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">130FE</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+130FE kEH_Desc The head of a bovid (ox) with outwards curving horns.</tt></p><p>The description suggests outwards curving horns, unlike the Unicode 5.2 and Unicode 16 shapes.

The Database links to p. 53, l. 6 and pl. DCXIX of:</p><p><a href="https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara007.pdf">https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara007.pdf</a></p><p>Note that, first, a sign list is not a token list, and one cannot keep changing the code charts every time 
a new token is found that has a slightly different graphical feature, and second, it would be very hard to make out the position of the tail

I propose removing mention of the tail in the description as overspecific. 
For many baboon signs in the extended list, the position of the tail is not mentioned either.
One trick to be entirely non-committal would be to move the baboon and the "sheath or receptacle" closer together so the
tail is hidden altogether.</p><p>One remaining issue is that the original shape didn't have the diamond marking. What is the justification for adding the diamond marking?
Neither transcription nor photo in the above link show the diamond marking.
The Database mentions another token and adds "nor is the diamond shape in the W3 that clear". This suggests to me 
that there was considerable doubt whether the diamond marking was correct to begin with. It might be safest to revert to
the Unicode 5.2 shape entirely and also remove the diamond marking.</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/78088.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/78088.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">13108</div></td><td><img src="glyphs16/80771.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">13B83</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+13108 kEH_Desc The head and neck of a long-necked horned animal, with a forked end to the neck with a horizontal line over the forked end.</tt><br/><tt>U+13B83 kEH_Desc The head and neck of a long-necked horned animal, with a horizontal line written over the neck, near the bottom.</tt></p><p>The original shape was misplaced at U+13B83.

less pointed teeth. Gardiner (1957) characterizes the sign as "lower jaw-bone of ox", and as far as I know, oxen are not particularly known for having pointed teeth. But does this necessarily mean that the original shape of U+13112 and U+13BB2 differ in what they are meant to represent? Unless there is solid evidence that the original shape of U+13112 was wrong or uncharacteristic, it may be better to revert the shape to something closer to Unicode 5.2. It is then an open question whether the current shape of U+13BB2 deserves its own (core) code point, or whether it is just a duplicate of U+13112.</p><p>I don't see the original shape of U+13112 anywhere in the Database, and there doesn't seem to be even a shred of an acknowledgement that the shape changed from Unicode 5.2 to Unicode 16, let alone a justification for the change.</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/78173.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/78173.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">1315D</div></td><td><img src="glyphs16/80989.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">13C5D</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+1315D kEH_Desc An African sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus) (G26A), on top of a standard used for carrying religious symbols (R12).</tt><br/><tt>U+13C5D kEH_Desc An African sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus) (G26A), on top of a standard used for the carrying of religious symbols with the vertical stick at the far side (R92A). </tt></p><p>The glyphs of U+1315D in Unicode 5.2 and Unicode 16 are virtually the same, and also the glyph at U+13C5D looks very similar.
There is only a slight difference in that the vertical beam for U+1315D is almost at the right end and the vertical beam for
U+13C5D is perfectly at the right end. The standard with the vertical beam perfectly at the right end is also known as
JSesh R92A.
Transcription practices don't seem to distinguish between "almost at the right end" and "perfectly at the right end".
For example, all of the tokens at:</p><p><a href="http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1307">http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1307</a></p><p><a href="http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1400">http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1400</a></p><p><a href="http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1517">http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1517</a></p><p>have a shape closer to U+13C5D in the photo but a shape closer to U+1315D in the transcription.</p><p>After querying whether U+13C5D needs to exist at all next to U+1315D, because they seem to be indistinguishable
for all practical purposes, there was the unexpected move to drastically change the glyph of U+1315D by giving it a literal
R12 standard as in the description, that is, a standard with the vertical beam roughly in the middle, and objects attached
to the left end, and this is the form currently in the draft charts.
This seems to be a much less common form for ibis-on-standard, 
even though it is the logo of the Thot Sign List. Most tokens seem to have a plain horizontal beam with attached objects and 
with the vertical beam perfectly or almost at the right end:</p><p><a href="https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=3456">https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=3456</a></p><p>This change will effectively make encoders use U+13C5D for the common shape that has formerly been at 
U+1315D from Unicode 5.2 until (and including) Unicode 16.
In this case as in other cases, moving or effectively moving glyphs to other code points 
does nothing but sow chaos and confusion,                                                                                  
causing many existing encodings to lose their validity overnight.
It would be enough to undermine users' trust in Unicode forever.</p><p>In the case of U+132BC and U+14107 below, 
the Database seems to hint at a rationale for moving a glyph to a new code point because that glyph might
be less frequent than another graphical variant. (I don't follow the reasoning, but let's assume that for now.)
Here, it seems to be the exact opposite. The variant with R92A is more frequent by far than the variant with the literal R12,
and yet there is supposedly a reason to move it to a new code point?
I'm puzzled what one hopes to achieve with this.</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/78179.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/78179.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">13163</div></td><td><img src="glyphs16/80970.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">13C4A</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+13163 kEH_Desc A gray heron (Ardea cinerea).</tt><br/><tt>U+13C4A kEH_Desc A gray heron (Ardea cinerea) with a lappet.</tt></p><p>It is by no more than a few black pixels, but it is unmistakable that the original shape was meant to exhibit a lappet.

Ideally, one would revert to Unicode 5.2 and give the shape a lappet. However this case is of lesser importance.

In consultation with Egyptologists it was decided to opt for the form in Unicode 5.2, fixed formally by letting UniKemet
link the code point to the occurrence on p. 477 as opposed to the occurrence on p. 545.
This was motivated by similar signs (like the newly introduced U+13DEE) that have the head up as well.
For more information, see pp. 8 and 39 of:</p><p><a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06354-n3181-egyptian.pdf">https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06354-n3181-egyptian.pdf</a></p><p>Whether or not one now agrees this was the right decision at the time, 
having studied (or not) the arguments laid out by Egyptologists in 2005-2009, 
all this should be irrelevant. 
The glyph should not change on a whim relative to what it has been for the past 15 years since Unicode 5.2. 
If anyone feels the need for the other orientation, a variation selector for rotation can be used.</p><p>Apropos, the Database has the fly with the head up as well, so it is not even clear to me any of the philologists 
actually wanted to have this sign rotated relative to the original orientation. In the end, the rotation may be due to clerical error.</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/78266.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/78266.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">131BA</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+131BA kEH_Desc A lotus bud with a long stalk, folded under itself.</tt></p><p>I couldn't care less about the length of the stalk in the glyph. This is a palaeographic detail and unimportant
at the level of Unicode.
I do object against the Database not even acknowledging that anything was changed, despite the fact that
the description above explicitly invalidates the character identity from Unicode 5.2 when the stalk was definitely not long.
In particular, there is nothing in the Database that suggests that a short stalk was wrong or atypical and therefore needed to be changed into
a long stalk.
The original form with the short stalk reappears in a different entry with the comment "Does not seem to be
a meaningful variant". Ok, but if the difference between the shapes was not significant, why was there any need for the shape to be changed?</p><p>So delete "long" from the description. Ideally one would also make the stalk a little shorter than the Unicode 16 form
but it could be a little longer than the Unicode 5.2 form.</p><p>I'm also reminded that the extended sign list introduced multiple code points U+13C9D and U+13C9F for a falcon
on a low cone and a falcon on a high cone. Similarly, separate code points U+13A01 and U+13A02
were introduced for a hand holding a long stick and a hand holding a short stick. Etc.
So apparently, it is important how big something is. But it is apparently not important anymore when it comes to 
existing code points, and no one thought twice about replacing the short stalk by the long stalk?
There seems to be a lack of consistency running through the entire Unicode 16 set.</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/78278.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/78278.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">131C6</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+131C6 kEH_Desc A cobra in repose (Naja haja, I10), written over a stem of papyrus with a bud (M13).</tt></p><p>Revert to the shape from Unicode 5.2.

That is not a meaningful distinction for Unicode. The issue is that the UniKemet documentation of the extended list
consistently makes a binary distinction whether sides of "building" signs are either vertical or oblique.
If anything, the tokens available for U+13271 show that such a binary distinction is an illusion.
For any such sign, one will be able to find tokens with slightly different angles, some of which might be almost perfectly 90 degrees,
others will be visibly smaller.

There are two
tokens without circle and one token with circle. The only thing this tells us is that the sign occurs both without circle
and with circle. It does not in any way tell us that the originally intended shape
of U+13277 in Unicode 5.2 should have a circle. The only ground truth in this respect is the original UniKemet, which 
defines O025A to be the shape that occurs on p. 246 of Gardiner (1931) and on p. 4 of Gardiner (1953) and that
very clearly has no circle. Cf. p. 42 of:</p><p><a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06354-n3181-egyptian.pdf">https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06354-n3181-egyptian.pdf</a></p><p>and pp. 44 and 49 of:</p><p><a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2005/05313-Gardiner28-57.pdf">https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2005/05313-Gardiner28-57.pdf</a></p><p>Gardiner (1931) gives us some indication about the function of the sign: 
"Det. names of sun-obelisks". But this is consistent with the function "sun temple" listed by
the TSL to cover both the circled and the uncircled forms, and so also this offers no justification for changing the

Each and every existing encoding containing this sign from the past 15 years, no matter the orientation, 
will now have become invalid overnight due to this change.</p><p>Apparently the position was taken that the original glyph must have been an error because prow and stern 
are reversed relative to the more common orientation of boats. 
However, there are several examples of boats in the extended list where the orientation is not as expected either; 
e.g. U+1406E versus U+1406F and U+1406A versus U+1406B. It seems to happen particularly often in the writing of ḫntj, "sail south", that
prow and stern are reversed. It is unimaginable that Gardiner (1928) made a mistake due to being ignorant of
the difference between prow and stern, and it is far more likely that he needed this glyph for an inscription
where the boat was genuinely oriented as it was in Unicode 5.2.</p><p>Now one may take the position that the orientation of boats should be normalized to have the prow always
at the left, but then this is inconsistent with what was done elsewhere for the extended list.
The Database has "it probably exists somewhere, but I have no idea where", which rules out that
this matter was sufficiently analyzed to justify the disruption that this matter caused.</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/78513.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/78513.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">132B1</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+132B1 kEH_Desc Three circular items, arranged horizontally, on a one legged table with a bowl-shaped surface.</tt></p><p>I don't mind the slight change of shape.

The Database has "only(?) attested in Gardiner" suggesting that the original shape is a rare, anomalous form of the 
cloth-on-pole-and-butchers-block,
and therefore somehow deserves to be moved to another code point, although I cannot follow that reasoning at all
(frequency and code points are unrelated concepts).
But there is a photo of a token in the Database, and it didn't take me long to find another occurrence:</p><p><a href="https://mnamon.sns.it/index.php?page=Immagini&amp;id=32&amp;img=5&amp;lang=en">https://mnamon.sns.it/index.php?page=Immagini&amp;id=32&amp;img=5&amp;lang=en</a></p><p>Another one possibly on p. 211 of:</p><p><a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdfplus/10.1086/671433">https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdfplus/10.1086/671433</a></p><p>I have found more potential tokens, but often the issue is that in some texts the internal decoration of the butchers block 
takes the form of a single vertical line. It is then a matter of subjective judgement whether the thickness or position of that line 
differs enough from the pole to be seen as two different things.
A good example is:</p><p><a href="https://journals.ekb.eg/article_402870_007f1ac8fd3d7458010f289771ab1391.pdf">https://journals.ekb.eg/article_402870_007f1ac8fd3d7458010f289771ab1391.pdf</a></p><p>The transcription has the sign with "pole-over-block", but upon closer inspection the photo seems to suggest "pole-on-block".</p><p>Altogether, it doesn't appear this is a rare sign at all, on the contrary,
and if ever special treatment is warranted for rare signs, 
then this does not apply here. In any case, moving a sign creates severe disruption to fonts and to encoders, and next to
these disadvantages, there are absolutely no advantages of any kind.</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/78582.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/78582.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">132F6</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+132F6 kEH_Desc A sickle (U1), written over a folded piece of cloth (S29).</tt></p><p>The description matches the original shape but not the new shape.

But by putting "with a handle resembling ..." in the description, one is suggesting that M13 is an essential part of the character identity of U+1331C, whereas (as far as I know) scimitars do not generally have a handle resembling M13. The Database does not motivate departing from the original shape. 
The TSL has one single token of T016A (without citation!), which is rather blurry and does not seem to suggest M13 at all:</p><p><a href="https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=5850">https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=5850</a></p><p>Various examples taken from iconography are here:</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/zcfv4z/the_khopesh_of_ancient_egypt/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowofgold_Essays/comments/zcfv4z/the_khopesh_of_ancient_egypt/</a></p><p>I don't see the shape of M13 in any of them.

Instead, the Database
refers to the Pyramid of Unas, which is off by 2 millennia so this is unlikely to be relevant to U+1334C. It is unclear to me how other newly introduced code points for hair-pins are supposed to relate to the original shape of U+1334C, or even how to characterize the difference between U+1334C and usual hairpin U+1334B. It becomes an exercise in futility if new code points are introduced for barely distinguishable shapes, as if those are meaningful for Unicode, while exact specifications of existing code points are ignored to reuse these code points
for totally different things. One either takes the character identities of code points seriously, or one does not, in which case why do we even bother with Unicode?</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/78669.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/78669.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">1334D</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+1334D kEH_Desc A drill, with a half-circle handle, with a backwards tick on top of the handle, with a forked drill-bit with a horizontal line on top of the forked drill-bit, with a short vertical stroke next to the drill, connected to the handle.</tt></p><p>The original shape had a round drill-bit.
The Database does not acknowledge that the shape of the drill-bit has changed, let alone offer a

Given the many instances of round drill-bits among several newly introduced glyphs in the extended list, it is
uncontroversial that round drill-bits are very frequent in this and similar signs, and so there is no
rational basis for changing the Unicode form as it has existed since Unicode 5.2.</p><p>The phrase "a horizontal line on top of" is used elsewhere in UniKemet to mean something different from what is in the glyph.
What is in the glyph would elsewhere in UniKemet be phrased as "a horizontal line over";

I have no objection to the glyph being represented with greater clarity, but
is it part of the character identity that the plummet resembles a heart?
The Database has "only one token comes close, and it still lacks the heart", so I assume the answer is no.
It seems therefore better to leave out details that may well be hallucinated or uncharacteristic for the sign.

In this instance, the Database seems to offer adequate justification for a change to a glyph. 
Both Urk IV 57,3, supposedly the source of the sign according to Gardiner (1928), and the earlier publication by Bouriant it was based on

A similar sign is:</p><p><a href="https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=883">https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=883</a></p><p>but there the hands are oriented inwards, provided the blurry photos are interpreted correctly.

replace the old glyph by the new glyph.
However, the orientation of the hands was apparently important enough to distinguish
U+137E9 and U+137EA and give them separate code points. (All these signs seem to be functionally 
indistinguishable: ḥḥ, "million".)
So what is it? Is the orientation of the hands important, or is it not important?
There seems to be a lack of consistency running through the entire Unicode 16 set.</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/77935.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/77935.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">1306F</div></td><td><img src="glyphs16/79709.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">1375D</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+1306F kEH_Desc God, seated, both knees down, with a long curved beard and long hair/wig, wearing a headdress consisting of two feathers on rams horns (S77).</tt><br/><tt>U+1375D kEH_Desc God, seated, both knees up, with covered legs and arms, with a long curved beard and long hair/wig, with an uraeus on the forehead, wearing a headdress consisting of two feathers and a sun-disk on rams horns, with an uraeus at either side of the feathers; holding a sceptre with a straight shaft, topped with the head of the Seth animal vertically.</tt></p><p>For U+1306F, the sun-disk was removed.

The Database justifies adding the uraeus by the observation that many occurrences have a uraeus, calling
this "correcting" of the glyph. I don't think the word "correcting" is appropriate if occurrences 
without uraeus exist, and then the glyph without uraeus would not be incorrect per se.
Nonetheless this change to the glyph may cause relatively little disruption, provided no one will now consider 
introducing a new code point for the original form without uraeus, as this would create yet another case of a misplaced
sign, which is to be avoided at all costs.</p><p class="done">This identifies a major shortcoming of the kEH_Desc descriptions: a description describes a single 'representative' token that 
the philologists happened to find, down to minute detail. The new UniKemet also typically lists only the one function of that
one token.
But this fails to capture the type. For example,
if in the future the intention is that U+130E8 can be used for the sign with uraeus and the sign without uraeus,
then currently no documentation exists that expresses this intention. In this sense, this is a step back from the documentation in GEG, 
which, by being less overspecific about appearances of signs, avoided the suggestion that signs could only be used for tokens
with narrowly defined graphical attributes.</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/78067.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/78067.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">130F3</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+130F3 kEH_Desc A basket with four pieces of grain or fruit (M39) in front of an oryx, standing (E28), on top of a parcel of land with irrigation ditches (N24).</tt></p><p>Unicode 5.2 form did not have the four pieces of grain or fruit.

In the Database, I see no reflection on this. The Database has a reference to:</p><p><a href="http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1202">http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1202</a></p><p>which has yet another form of the standard,
with diagonal bar rather than "a loop under the horizontal beam, running over the vertical pole".
It would be fine to normalize glyphs when it comes to the type of standard, and to use a default form of R12 for any signs with
a standard that is similar to R12. But this is not what was done elsewhere, especially for the extended list
(cf. U+13F14 versus U+13F15, U+13F1D versus U+13F1E).
There appears to have been no consistent strategy for the treatment of standards.</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/78402.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/78402.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">13242</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+13242 kEH_Desc A wick of twisted flax, consisting of 3 loops (V28), in front of the red crown (S3), in front of three ripples of water, vertically aligned above one another (N35A); on top of a standard used for carrying religious symbols (R12), written on top of a parcel of land with irrigation ditches (N24).</tt></p><p>In the original, the standard was simplified.
The Database has "Transcription only. Inclusion in core based on principle, not verification with image".
How then can a change to the glyph be justified?</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/78406.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/78406.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">13246</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+13246 kEH_Desc A desert hare, lying down (E34), on top of a standard used for the carrying of religious symbols (R12), on top of a parcel of land with irrigation ditches (N24).</tt></p><p>The standards are different, although both standards are often referred to as instances of R12.
Also, in the original, the hare had whiskers.</p><p>The Database lists both the original shape and the new shape, in different entries, without acknowledging
that the standard in U+13246 changed between Unicode 5.2 and Unicode 16. According to the Database the two forms are
"practically identical". I don't necessarily disagree with this, but if the two forms are practically identical,
then why was a change needed in the first place? Because an attestation
could be found for one form and not for the other? Will the shape of U+13246 change back once the original form is attested?</p><p>I detect an eagerness to change glyphs in the code charts for the sake of making changes, not because there is any
compelling need. To destroy and remake in one's image is not in the interests of the user community.</p><p>By the way, there is a token where the standard is somewhere in between the standards above.

As the Database points out, the Unicode 5.2 form differs from what, according to the original UniKemet, should have been
the source, namely Gardiner (1953).

The Database notes that a supposed token of this sign has been identified that has "X1 behind what looks like a U8".
This could be in the second column in the photo of:</p><p><a href="http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1128">http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1128</a></p><p>where X1 is to the left of what looks like U8, so "behind" in terms of reading order.
(See also the first column, where there is the same combination of X1 and what looks like U8, but without standard.)
I suspect the new glyph for Unicode 16 was created with the misunderstanding that "behind" meant "overlay".</p><p>Assuming that the above text correctly identifies the sign that Gardiner had in mind (which is not at all clear to me), 
then a redrawing of the glyph may be in order.

The Database does not contain a shred of reflection on the fact that the shape has changed.
No doubt the Unicode 16 form exists, but so does the Unicode 5.2 form, for example here:</p><p><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/546944">https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/546944</a></p><p><a href="https://blogs.bl.uk/.a/6a00d8341c464853ef02e860ece6b0200b-pi">https://blogs.bl.uk/.a/6a00d8341c464853ef02e860ece6b0200b-pi</a></p><p>One would have to have very good arguments not to revert to the Unicode 5.2 form.

to stumble upon a token of the Unicode 16 form first is not a good enough argument.
In any case "with a rounded top" is not part of the character identity of this code point as introduced in Unicode 5.2
and should not be in the description. If the variant with rounded top is considered to be fundamentally distinct, 
then it should be this variant that appears under a new code point.</p><table class="glyph_table"><tbody><tr><td><img src="glyphs5/78533.png" class="image5"/><img src="glyphs16/78533.png" class="image16"/><div class="code">132C5</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><tt>U+132C5 kEH_Desc A wig, with a fillet, with a headdress consisting of two feathers on top of the horns of a ram (S77), on top of a vertical pole, on top of a parcel of land with irrigation ditches (N24).</tt></p><p>The headdress lost the sun disk.

But, first, the extended list often introduced multiple code points 
for signs with and without internal details. So apparently, in those cases internal details were important enough to warrant multiple
code points. But internal details were apparently so unimportant that it was fine to
unceremoniously purge them from U+1342D, a well-known sign that appears with these internal details
in almost every printed and digital sign list. At the very least, this lacks consistency.</p><p>Second, just because within the available time no token of Aa31 could be identified with visible diagonal strokes,
that does not mean that no such tokens exist. 
Moreover, a sign list is not a list of tokens, it is a list of types.
A type (sign) is an abstraction of potentially many tokens, rather than a facsimile of one particular token,
and could have more or fewer graphical features than any particular known token.</p><p>Third, it is underappreciated that the main purpose of a glyph in a normalized font is to communicate the identity
of a sign to the reader. Everyone would immediately recognize the form with the internal details as Aa31, as it appears like that
in almost every printed and digital sign list. 
Even the normalized font of the TSL displays Aa31 with internal details.
Leaving out the internal details from Aa31 in Unicode fonts will cause unnecessary confusion to users.
I'm also reminded of Point 5 of the Encoding Principles:</p><p><a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr57/tr57-4.html#EncodingPrinciples">https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr57/tr57-4.html#EncodingPrinciples</a></p><p>which has "inner detailing [...] helps in avoiding confusion". This is one of the Encoding Principles that makes sense.</p><p>I don't see any downsides to keeping the internal details either.
The devil's advocate would say that a student would be misled into thinking that
any token of Aa31 in a real inscription must have all the internal details
that the normalized glyph has. But even a beginning student would know that this is not how the writing system works.</p><p>It appears that the unannounced revision of the basic sign list that no one asked for
was guided by an eagerness to destroy and remake in one's image,
from the perspective of palaeographic special interests,
rather than by any considerations about the
continuity of Unicode or what would be best for typical users.</p><h2>Why moving signs between code points is harmful</h2>

Since Unicode 5.2, released in 2009, a large collection of fonts, tools, encodings, data bases, and teaching materials
have been created
that all assume the signs as assigned to code points in Unicode 5.2. 
There are more than half a dozen publicly released hieroglyphic fonts by now, and possibly more that
were not publicly released.
Many encodings of texts have been created with tools that use one of these fonts.
These fonts and these encodings may be 
distributed and redistributed on the web, without any central control.
<p>
Now suppose a sign is moved to a different code point, and the old code point is given a new sign. 
It then immediately becomes uncertain what the intention is of that old code point.
For a new encoding, it depends on the encoder, who needs to make sure they use an up-to-date version of a
hieroglyphic text processing tool. In turn it depends on the developer of that tool, 
who has to make sure they have an up-to-date version of the font.
In turn it depends on the font creator, who has to check an up-to-date version of the Unicode code charts
for any changes. (With the sign list now having grown from formerly just over 1000 signs to about 5000 signs,
this is quite a challenge in itself.)
Any existing encoding immediately loses its validity, as the code points will no longer reflect 
the intentions of the encoder. The encoder will need to revisit their encodings and make corrections.
Also databases and teaching materials need to be updated. This is the most optimistic case, assuming the encoders and
creators of databases and teaching materials are still available to make the necessary updates.
</p><p>
Naively one could argue that the date of creation of an encoding determines how code points are to be
interpreted. If it was created before the change was made, then it is the original interpretation of the code points.
If it was created one or two years after the change to the code charts, after hopefully all fonts and tools had been
updated (which may be overly optimistic), then it is the new interpretation of the code points.
The problem is that one cannot see from an encoding when it was created. A web page containing hieroglyphic
encodings created in the past does not have a special label saying "this page was created before 2024 when the Unicode
sign list was upended".
</p><p>
In short, if the aim is to be able to distinguish two glyphs, which are not to be confused
any more in future encodings, then the first step should <b>not</b> be to assign one glyph to the code point that 
hitherto belonged to the other, as this creates the confusion that one aimed to avoid.
</p><p>
In the Database, there appear to be vague references to some graphical variants being less common than others
and I'm guessing (and no more than guessing) 
that the underlying assumption was that Gardiner chose a rare or atypical graphical variant to represent a
grapheme, and that is why in the past when the code point was used, the
encoder "really" intended the more common variant. I don't think that holds up to scrutiny.
In the case of the pole-on-block versus pole-over-block for example (see U+132BC above), I strongly
suspect the evidence was misinterpreted. Moreover, second-guessing the "real" intentions of
some hypothetical encoder of some hypothetical inscription in the past is a precarious undertaking. One cannot know under what circumstances
existing encodings were created. Some graphical variants may be more common for some periods than for others.
And perhaps the encoder intended to digitize Gardiner's grammar rather than encode a randomly chosen
inscription from a random period, and so definitely intended Gardiner's glyphs and not the new glyphs assigned to the 
old code points.
</p><p>
One more problem that arises when signs are moved may have been overlooked.
Consider a line in the UniKemet database like:
</p><blockquote>
U+143C7 kEH_JSesh   X4E
</blockquote>
This means that JSesh X4E is tied to code point U+143C7.  This JSesh X4E is not some platonic idea of a character that could have different graphical realizations, it is one concrete glyph that exists in the font of the JSesh editor. (It is ironic that JSesh names are now treated as more immutable than Unicode code points, even though in the decades of JSesh's existence, I suspect the font has been subjected to many rounds of improvements and I have no idea whether X4E is the same glyph as it was 5 years ago or will be in 5 years from now. But this aside.)
<p>
What to do if the JSesh X4E glyph moves to a different code point, say in Unicode 25 ? The obvious answer is: the kEH_JSesh X4E entry will move with the glyph to the new code point.
</p><p>
Now consider UniKemet names. These must similarly stand for glyphs, not for code points or abstract platonic ideas of characters. In fact, just like JSesh names stand for glyphs in JSesh encodings, UniKemet names are used to denote glyphs in <a href="https://mjn.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/egyptian/res/">RES hieroglyphic encodings</a>, albeit without zero padding. 
To be consistent, if the glyph that used to be at U+132BC is moved to U+14107, then we should change:
</p><blockquote>
U+132BC kEH_UniK    R010A
</blockquote>
to:
<blockquote>
U+14107 kEH_UniK    R010A
</blockquote>
Currently, if I look in the UniKemet database under U+14107 I see nothing of the sort. It was given a fresh, unrelated UniKemet name R010H and there is nothing that reminds us that the reason this glyph was introduced in Unicode in the first place was because of Gardiner (1928), who called it R10*. It is ironic that the UniKemet database links code points to various sign lists, but not to Gardiner's sources that were the primary reason for their existence.
But if we update the UniKemet database to link U+14107 to the glyph R010A, then we still have the Unicode name "EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPH R010A" immutably (!) linked to U+132BC.  In other words, the Unicode names and the UniKemet names will now start to diverge, and this will be for just a handful of signs, while for the majority of the 1072 basic signs, the Unicode names and UniKemet names perfectly align. For the sake of completeness these are the moved code points:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr><th>old</th><th>new</th></tr>
<tr><td>U+13108</td><td>U+13B83</td></tr>
<tr><td>U+13163</td><td>U+13C4A</td></tr>
<tr><td>U+1324A</td><td>U+13CA7</td></tr>
<tr><td>U+13277</td><td>U+13FDC</td></tr>
<tr><td>U+132BC</td><td>U+14107</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
and then there are two more special cases that are less clear-cut:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr><th>old</th><th>new</th></tr>
<tr><td>U+1315D</td><td>U+13C5D</td></tr>
<tr><td>U+1334C</td><td>U+1334B</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
The divergence of UniKemet names from Unicode names would add one more naming headache to the various other naming headaches that already exist.
</p><p>
Moving signs to other code points has many disadvantages due to existing encodings, existing databases, existing fonts, and existing hieroglyphic processing tools. All of these disadvantages are severe and will continue to haunt the user community for years to come. The above naming issue is one more such disadvantage. On the flip side, there are no advantages. All perceived advantages of moving signs do not hold
up to scrutiny and are outweighed by far by the severe disadvantages.
</p><p>
Why not reverse course while it is still possible?
</p><p>
In the end, there is also the general Encoding Stability policy of Unicode:
</p><blockquote>
"Once a character is encoded, it will not be moved or removed." 
</blockquote>
[ <a href="https://www.unicode.org/policies/stability_policy.html">https://www.unicode.org/policies/stability_policy.html</a> ]
<p>
No doubt one can cite rare examples from the long history of Unicode where this policy was not strictly adhered to due
to exceptional circumstances and significant overriding concerns, in the absence of any real disruptions that this might cause.
But for the cases listed above, 
there are no exceptional circumstances or overriding concerns,
and all of this was entirely unnecessary.
As a long-time user, I experienced what happened to the basic list as extremely disruptive, and
I don't know why I'm told by those who never used the basic list that this was 
perfectly normal and acceptable.

</p><h2>Atomic glyphs of overlays</h2>

In the case of, for example, U+130C1 (forearm and leg overlayed; see above), 
one will find inscriptions where the forearm is depicted as being over the leg, 
inscriptions where the leg is depicted as being over the forearm, as well 
as inscriptions where the "z-order" is indeterminate, that is, where 
the curves of the forearm and leg simply cross one another.
This is a palaeographic matter, and therefore Unicode appropriately does not attempt to
encode these different graphical realizations, 
and the single code point U+130C1 is meant to cover all three cases.
<p>
Nonetheless, there are advantages to keeping the z-order of glyphs 
in the code charts of such composite
glyphs unchanged (in the absence of any compelling reasons for any change). 
This has to do with hieroglyphic processing
tools that are built on top of the Unicode sign list 
and that provide support for a more faithful specification of the positioning of
signs in a hieroglyphic inscription than would ever be possible in Unicode. I'm in particular referring to
<a href="https://mjn.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/egyptian/res/">RES</a>, which was
mentioned before. It allows scaling of signs, fine-tuning of distances between signs, 
arbitrary degrees of rotation, and so on.
RES also allows specification of z-order of overlays in the case of compositional encoding. 
The reason RES can do this is because its three implementations are in general-purpose
programming languages (C, Java, JavaScript), in which one can implement graphical algorithms
that are beyond the power of typical Unicode technology such as OpenType.
For example, the Unicode 5.2 glyph of U+130C1 can be expressed in RES as:
</p><blockquote>
stack[on](D36,D58)
</blockquote>
whereas its Unicode 16 glyph corresponds to:
<blockquote>
stack[under](D36,D58)
</blockquote>
The indeterminate form, where conceptually the two signs have the same z-order, 
is expressed by:
<blockquote>
stack(D36,D58)
</blockquote>
Because U+130C1 has an individual name D59 for the atomically encoded overlay, derived from the
UniKemet names of the Unicode 5.2 set, the first of these could alternatively be encoded as:
<blockquote>
D59
</blockquote>
Regrettably, with a font created according to the Unicode 16 code charts,
D59 has now become equivalent to stack[under](D36,D58) instead.
It is very likely that some RES encodings created in the past will thereby have become 
inconsistent with the intentions of the encoders.
<p>
I don't see any downsides to reverting to the Unicode 5.2 forms for composite signs, 
all the more as the Database offers no evidence in favour of any of
the variant graphical realizations with different z-orders, implying that 
there was never any compelling reason to depart from the Unicode 5.2 forms to begin with.
Moreover, composite signs such as U+130C1 were declared "Legacy" in favour of compositional
encoding using the OVERLAY control, and therefore the glyphs of such signs will not affect
future users who intend to avoid legacy signs altogether.
</p><p>
Incidentally, the motivation for RES was to address the problem that
the longevity of hieroglyphic encodings is very limited with
traditional means, and changing to a different font, 
changing to a different tool, or even changing to a different version of the same tool
often meant that an existing encoding lost its validity.
This has arguably plagued the field for decades. For background see
<a href="https://mjn.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/publications/2013b.pdf">The Manuel de Codage encoding of hieroglyphs impedes development of corpora</a> and
<a href="https://mjn.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/publications/2021a.pdf">Formatting of Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic text</a>.
</p><p>
The reason why RES was designed on top of Unicode was because at the time
it was anticipated that Unicode would provide better stability than the various versions
of the Manuel de Codage signs lists and the Hieroglyphica and their implementations
in various tools. The trust that I placed in Unicode at the time
was that it would not fundamentally change characters without compelling reasons at the very least,
in the light of Unicode's stability policies.
