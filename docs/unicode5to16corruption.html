    <h1>Differences Unicode 5.2 / Unicode 16</h1>
    <p>Where two glyphs are given for the same code point, the first is from Unicode 5.2 and the second is from Unicode 16. The glyphs were automatically extracted from the official PDF code charts. Lines in blue starting with code point and kEH_Desc are descriptions copied verbatim from Unikemet.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The staff in the original shape of U+13017 already had a slight backward angle, unlike the Unicode 16 form, where the staff is perfectly vertical. This will be solved in Unicode 17 by redrawing U+13017 to have the staff at a backward angle, like in the original shape. But then U+13017 and U+134CD will differ by no more than the exact degree of the angle, which seems a far-fetched distinction to make for the purposes of Unicode.</p>

    <p>These are arguably only insignificant graphical variants of the same thing, but unless one can argue that one variant is real and the other variant is not real (never occurs), one should revert to the original Unicode 5.2 variant, and change description and image accordingly. Incidentally, both forms exist in GEG. Around 2009, there were discussions about which of the two was the most appropriate form for Unicode, and in consultation with Egyptologists it was decided to opt for the form in Unicode 5.2. Whether or not you agree this was the right decision should be irrelevant. Code charts should not be changed without a compelling reason.</p>

    <p>The description of U+1315D does not match the images. The original shape has a standard closer to R92A.

    <p>Around 2009, there were protracted discussions about what the most appropriate orientation was for Unicode, since both orientations occur in GEG, and the sign was taken from iconography and is not attested in actual running text. In consultation with Egyptologists it was decided to opt for the form in Unicode 5.2. Whether or not you agree this was the right decision back then, having studied (or not) the arguments laid out by Egyptologists in 2009, all this should be irrelevant. The glyph should not change on a whim relative to what it has been for the past 15 years since Unicode 5.2. If anyone feels a need for the other orientation, a variation selector for rotation can be used.</p>

    <p>The original shape of U+1334C seems to have a horizontal line on the top, so the new shape is not right, unless one can make a convincing case that the original shape was due to a misinterpretation. The intended use of U+1334C is for "a later form of U23" (Gardiner 1931) as found on the 26th Dyn. sarcophagus of Ankhnesneferibra (EA32). There is a photo on the BM website (see below link), but I have been unable to spot any tokens of U23 that Gardiner might have had in mind. The Database refers to the Pyramid of Unas, which is off by more than 2 millennia so this is unlikely to be relevant to U+1334C. It is unclear to me how the original shape of U+1334C relates to other, newly introduced code points for hair-pins.</p>

    <p>In U+13043, there was a line representing the ground, and there was no connecting rope. Now there is no line for the ground and there is a rope connecting the two pieces of the hoe. There may be good reasons to update the glyph, provided one can argue that the original form was incorrect. But there is a sign U+1333C for a hoe without connecting rope, so the original glyph of U+13043 is not implausible. If so far no token of U+13043 was located without connecting rope, then what are you going to do if you do find such a token, introduce a new code point for it? This is disastrous for the stability of Unicode.</p>

    <p>It is debatable whether the original shape has the folded piece of cloth on top, or whether the intention was to underspecify which of the two signs is on top.

There are several more such cases.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The original shape underspecified which of the signs is on top. It seems fine to me to clarify the desired appearance as is done here. One worry for this case and for related cases is this: if the description mentioning which sign is on top is based on just one occurrence, and if in fact both possibilities exist, then the description is unduly specific. It would then be better to simply say that this is an overlay without specifying which sign is on top.</p>
