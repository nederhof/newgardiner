    </p>
    <p>The "left foot horizontal" in the description of U+13473 suggest its glyph is wrong and should be
like the position of the feet in U+13462.
The Database seems to point in the same direction,
using a blurry image that may suggest that the left foot is more likely to be horizontal than vertical.
What this blurry image does not convince me of is that the "right foot [is] in front of the left knee".
</p>
    <p>
More generally, it is not clear to me whether the exact position of the right foot in such signs, 
a few pixels further to the left or to the right (a non-discrete difference regardless of whether
the right foot then happens to be in front of the left knee), 
is ever significant and worth including in the description.
A case in point may be U+13462, which seems to be functionally identical to U+13000.
Is the one poorly preserved example in the Database the only token that "verifies" the status of U+13462
as independent sign rather than a casually carved instance of U+13000?

    </p>
    <p>The "front arm" is quite confusing. It is not the arm closest to the reader (I guess) but the arm connected to the shoulder closest to an
imaginary person facing the man. Why not just "left arm" to disambiguate?

Can anyone really tell the orientation of the hands from this badly carved stela, with a crack
roughly where the hands are? If not, can the orientation of the hands be omitted from the description as overspecific?

    <p>Is it just a "backward line"? The glyph suggests it is something more, namely presence of a notch, making this M4.
The Database points to p. 287, l. 4 of:

    </p>
    <p>The hairstyle in the glyph of U+134E4 does not appear to be a coif.
The Database does not contain a reference to a token. In contrast, the Database does 
contain a reference for U+134E3, namely pl. 218 and pl. 219 of:

but no hairstyle is mentioned in the description of U+134E3. 
It seems inconsistent to be overly specific about hairstyle when the token could not be verified, while
not specifying the hairstyle at all when a very clear photo is available.
My preference would be not to specify hairstyles where it does not seem to matter much.

    <p>The glyph does not have both knees raised.

The Database has "Attested in TSL, not considered a meaningful variant [of A005A]". What was not a meaningful variant, the
shape with both knees raised as in the description, or the shape with one knee raised as in the glyph? 
And why did the sign end up in the core set nonetheless, on the basis of what graphical differences?

    <p>The glyph has four flowers, not three.
To avoid inconsistency between description and glyph, the
description in Unicode 17 has "several papyrus flowers".
</p>
    <p>
For the record, the reference the Database points to does seem to depict four flowers, cf. p. 388 of:

The "back straight" is not accurate with regard to the facsimile. 
It appears the description is overspecific to the point
of hallucinating what is not there. Or alternatively, the glyph in some arbitrary font was overinterpreted.

</p>
    <p>
If the oar is at 45 degrees, and the hands are both on the oar, then the hands cannot both be at the height of the shoulders. I think the description tries to be overly precise, to the point of no longer making sense. I would omit "hands at the height of the shoulders".

      <tt>U+135A4 kEH_Desc Man (king) running, wearing the red crown (S3) right arm in front, hand at the hight of the waist, holding a vertical spear with the point at the top, left arm raised, forearm nearly vertical, holding a stick which runs from the head to slightly beyond the hand.</tt>
    </p>
    <p>The "stick" looks more like a mace in the glyph.
The Database refers to:

    <p>
      <a href="http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1021">http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/1021</a>
    </p>
    <p>
In the photo, the "stick" indeed seems to have a wide bulb at the end. Can an educated guess be made, so
at least description and glyph can become consistent, either by changing description or changing glyph? 
Another solution is to make the description broader, say by writing "holding stick or mace".
</p>
    <p>
The "to slightly beyond the hand" does not accurately describes the photo; the stick/mace does not
extend beyond the hand. And the end of the stick/mace is not near the head, although it is near the crown
on top of the head.
A typical case of overinterpreting the normalized glyph of the transcription, and moreover
the description is overly specific by any reasonable measure.

    <p class="done">The extended list aimed to distinguish between gods (to be systematically depicted with curved beards) and kings 
(to be systematically depicted with straight beards). However, more often than
not, the glyphs in Unicode 16 are inconsistent with this principle, as exemplified above.
Unicode 17 corrected many god and king signs.

    <p>Minor issue, but U+136AD does not have the same variant of R12 as U+136AC.
Should that matter? If not, then fine, and I assume that font designers are free to
treat the two variants as interchangeable. But then I see a problem in that on other occasions,
multiple code points were introduced for the same underlying sign, depending on the variant of standard;
e.g. U+1315D versus U+13C5D. There appears to be no consistency.

    <p>There is no beard in the glyph. I don't think the hairstyle in the glyph is a "coif".

    </p>
    <p>In the glyph of U+136C7, there is something that looks like a headrest, not mentioned in the description,
although the description does mention a "long straight beard", which might have been misinterpreted as
headrest when the glyph was created.
The headrest was confirmed to be an error, and was removed from the glyph in Unicode 17.
But now the Unicode 17 glyph also doesn't have a beard, whereas the beard is still mentioned
in the description.
</p>
    <p>
Further, what appears to be a uraeus in U+136C6 is reportedly an error and was removed in Unicode 17.
The description of U+136C7 in Unicode 17 still mentions a uraeus, while
the glyph of U+136C7 in Unicode 17 no longer depicts a uraeus. It needs to be double-checked
with the philologists what the intention was.
</p>
    <p>
Incidentally, U+136C6 was reportedly not meant to become a core sign in Unicode 16, 
but is still marked as core sign in Unicode 17.

Remove "a" from "with a leonid legs".

    </p>
    <p>In the glyph of U+136FF, the hands don't appear to be "in a clapping motion". I imagine that for this, 
one would at least have to have the hand palms directed towards one another,
as they are in U+13736 for example.
The Database points to p. 3 of:

The photo shows an orientation of the hands that much more convincingly suggests clapping, *not*
with the hand palms upward as in the glyph.

    <p>In all four glyphs, only one lower leg is visible. But why on earth should we care whether 
one or two legs are visible and whether the legs are separated (unless we are engaged in hard-core palaeographic studies, 
which are outside the domain of Unicode)? I would suggest omitting "lower legs separated".

    <p>I would leave it at "hand palms upwards". The "hands horizontal" is not consistent with the glyph and that the hands are "half-way" horizontal is already implied by "hand palms upwards".
You are doing a grave disservice to users of Unicode by feeding them inconsistent information.
In particular, you are making the job of font designers impossible.
If you cannot ensure that the glyph in the code charts
is consistent with the description, then there is no point making the description so specific.

    <p>I don't think the object in the glyph can be called simply "rectangular". Perhaps "shaped as capital L mirrored horizontally"? 
This is assuming the glyph is accurate. Or is the description accurate?

The Database offers some pointers. The one I have been able to locate online is p. 312 of:

    </p>

where there are two occurrences. The object there is much more like one big rectangle, albeit with another, much smaller rectangle sticking out 
at the lower-front corner; not at all like the proportions in the current glyph.

    </p>
    <p>The hands in the glyph are not horizontal by any stretch of the imagination. I would leave it at "hand palms downwards", which probably
implies what was meant.
</p>
    <p>
Further, the glyph does a particularly poor job of depicting that hair is hanging forward (or I would say:
hanging down).
For an example, the Database points here (fourth column from the left):

There is another example of a woman bending down with hair hanging down in the iconography in the upper left corner.
In both cases, the hands are not horizontal by any stretch of the imagination.

It becomes an exercise in futility if we expect Unicode to encode

    </p>
    <p>There are no (forward curling) horns in the glyphs of U+1380B and U+13815.
</p>
    <p>
For both, the Database has "rather hard to see [...] hence it could be called without horns".
If the horns are there, but are just hard to see, I would normalize the glyph to have them anyway.
But now the problem is that U+13815 and U+13813 become the same sign apart from the exact shape of the horns, which
strays well into the domain of palaeography.

    </p>
    <p>The description of U+13813 does not mention the sun disk.
The Database has "is a bit small for a sun-disk", further suggesting it might be a cobra.
But there is a code point U+1380D specifically for the sign with cobra. So if U+13813 has a right to exist at all, 
then it should be with the interpretation of the object on the horns as sun disk. If some day that turns out to be an error
and the sign with sun disk never actually existed, then too bad.
</p>
    <p>
In any case, there should be no inconsistency between description and glyph as this makes the job
of font designers impossible.

    <p>In the glyph, the left hand is not at the wheel, it is at the vessel. The right foot is not really at the base of the wheel. But who cares! Does the description need to be so precise? It could be simplified like the description of U+13817 was simplified recently.

    <p>Unicode 17 made the glyph consistent with the description by letting the god touch the wall.

But an unresolved issue is that there are no (forward curving) horns in the glyph.
The Database has "Requires another redraw, withouth the horizontal horns". Why was the glyph redrawn without the horns if the
description has "with [...] horns"? As above, if the horns were once supposedly there, but are just not easily visible anymore, 
then I would draw them anyway.

It is not clear in the glyph that the lines below the mat connect to the flowers, rather than to the waterpots.

    </p>
    <p>No arm is visible in the glyph. My suggestion is to replace "arm forward, forearm following the angle of the upper leg, hand on the knee, horizontally, handpalm up, supporting" by simply "holding". Overly precise descriptions tend to be inconsistent with the glyphs
in the code charts. And anyway, who cares. The character identity could be captured by as little as "Seated ibis-headed god holding face".
</p>
    <p>
The Database mentions existence of one very detailed token where the arm is visible and argues that this should be
made visible in the glyph. But please realise that a character set is a list of types, not a list of tokens. 
A character is an abstraction of instances, not a facsimile of the most detailed instance of a character that one can find.

    </p>
    <p>The glyph does suggest a sun disk (in the middle above the horns). This has been confirmed to be an error.
In Unicode 17 one of the circles on the crown will be removed, but it is regrettably the wrong circle; the circle
on top of the crown should remain.

    </p>
    <p>In all three glyphs, the hand on the knee seems to hold an ankh sign as well, not mentioned in the description.

    </p>
    <p>
For U+138E3 see l. 4, and for U+138E4 see l. 10. The resolution of the PDF is low, but I would be
inclined to see an ankh sign in the tokens.
For U+138E8, the Database points to p. 227, l. 11 of:

This definitely has an ankh sign.
The forked bottom mentioned in the description is not visible in the transcription, so this mention should probably be removed.

    <p>The "circle" in U+138F9 looks perfectly identical to the "round vessel" from U+138F8.
If it is really just a circle (representing the sun?) and not a round vessel, then make sure it is perfectly round in the glyph.
Of if an educated guess can be made that it probably was a "round vessel", then amend the description.

For U+139C9 I'm also not sure how to interpret "angled forwards"; to me it looks like the other two (but
the angle is probably a palaeographic detail that deserves to be ignored anyway).

      <tt>U+139FF kEH_Desc A human hand, holding an oval, with the fingers and the thumb being the same length.</tt>
    </p>
    <p>Treating U+139FE and U+139FF as distinct from U+130AB strays well into the realm of
palaeography, which is normally considered to be outside the scope of Unicode.
The Database mentions for both U+139FE and U+139FF "Exists, but would already be covered by [...] U+130AB", but offers
no further justification why these two became core signs nonetheless.
</p>
    <p>
For U+139FF in particular, it seems hard to defend the length of the thumb as a reason to introduce a new code point.
For U+139FE, I don't really consider the thumb to be "upward" any more than in U+130AB; one slightly more obvious
graphical difference is that the egg is held at an angle in U+139FE, but the description does not
mention the angle of the egg as significant.
It would be hard to argue moreover that the hieroglyphic depiction of an "egg" and an "oval" are distinct.
Functionally, the signs are equivalent.

    <p>The loop around the neck in the glyph is an error. In Unicode 17, this has been removed.
The description has "four pieces" while the glyph has three. A clear case of an overly specific
description leading to avoidable problems. I suggesting omitting (at least) "four pieces of" in the description;
"a basket with grain or fruit" is specific enough.

    <p>I don't think that the glyph of 13AAE has the head of a jackal. The beak looks more like a falcon (although there are ears). 
Conversely, 13AAF doesn't look like it has the head of a falcon, and I think normally a griffin has the head of a falcon. Are the descriptions reversed?
</p>
    <p>
The glyph of U+13AAE does correspond to JSesh E80A and the glyph of U+13AAF does correspond to JSesh E80, so in 
this respect, UniKemet appears to be accurate.

For the purposes of Unicode, encoding the orientation of knives is nonsense anyway,

I find the glyph was correct after all and the description was wrong.
We are made to change glyphs back and forth based on
conflicting information, and at this point I've had enough.
If it really mattered how many knives there are, where these knives are positioned on the
body of the animal, whether the knives are angled forwards or backwards, 
and on which side the blades are,
then we would have been provided with accurate and consistent information from the start.
On the level of Unicode, it never made the slightest sense anyway 
to encode such palaeographic details, and given that after almost a year we've still not converged
should convince anyone by now that we cannot continue in this way.
</p>
    <p>
All one needs to specify the identity of this sign is something like "Torso of butchered bovid with knives".
Anything more than this serves no reasonable purpose.

    <p>In the glyph, it appears the mace head is towards the front (but at the back of the head of the jackal).
The Database points to p. 45, l. 3 and pl. 32 of:
</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara011.pdf">https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Dendara011.pdf</a>
    </p>
    <p>
The transcription seems to confirm the glyph is wrong, and the mace head is on the right. The photo is less clear.
The transcription also seems to suggest the mace is curved, but this is less important, as it may be an idiosyncrasy
of the token rather than a feature of the type.
</p>
    <p>
By the way, this example also shows why it never made any sense to treat overlays with "non-compositional" meaning any differently from
overlays with "compositional" meaning. With the overlay control, the graphical form would have been determined by the encoder, who could
if necessary use the mirroring control or variation selectors for rotation to choose an appropriate orientation of the mace. The Database
suggests that there are several variants of this sign, and one probably wouldn't want to introduce code points for all of them.
</p>
    <p>
The term "compositionality" is problematic for Ancient Egyptian anyway. There are many examples where a combination of
two signs combined with a simple vertical or horizontal joiner has a meaning that is not a composition 
of the meanings of the constituent signs.
There is no shortage of (non-overlaid) hieroglyphs, and we won't run out of new signs to add anytime soon, 
so why add more signs than necessary?

"overlay, but likely to difficult to render correctly with overlay tools."
</p>
    <p>
Wanting to get the appearance to be "perfect" is generally a pretty bad reason to include composed signs as atomic code points, and if you were to follow the same reasoning consistently you would need to include many dozens if not hundreds of composed signs, not just for overlays but also for insertions.  Even for the vertical joiner, one could make the appearance more "perfect" if a hare becomes flatter, which is why Gardiner had E034A (U+130FA) in his font. But E034A was deprecated (made legacy) for good reasons!
</p>
    <p>
HieroJax already has provisions to fine-tune the appearance of overlays, insertions and more. Cf.
</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax/ligaturelist.html">https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax/ligaturelist.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
It appears to be an internally inconsistent strategy to deprecate existing composed signs in the basic sign list like U+131A5 for nsw-bjtj (which is actually pretty difficult to get "perfect" if encoded compositionally) while introducing new composed signs in the extended sign list.
</p>
    <p>
For nsw-bjtj see Points 9 and 10 of the Encoding Principles in:
</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr57/tr57-4.html">https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr57/tr57-4.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
In particular under Point 10:
</p>
    <p>
"However, exceptions can be made for signs which are widely used"
</p>
    <p>
I would say that if exceptions can be made, then nsw-bjtj is a reasonable candidate for an exception. But U+13B88 and U+13B89 and U+13B8B are not.
</p>
    <p>
Moreover, for U+13B88 and U+13B8B, "written over" suggests the mouth occludes view of part of the antelope. If this is not what is meant then use a different phrase, e.g. "overlaid with". Similarly, for U+13B89, the glyph conversely suggests the antelope is over the ribs.

First, it assumes that a font cannot detect whether a sign is used with
or without an insertion and then automatically select an appropriate
glyph for that sign. For HieroJax that is absolutely not the case and I
cannot imagine that it is a problem for OpenType either. The task of
placing an inserted group in the correct position, and scaling it
appropriately, is several orders of magnitude more difficult than simply
detecting co-occurrence of two characters.
</p>
    <p>
Second, even if you assume that font technology is incapable of
selecting the most appropriate glyph depending on whether or not it is
used with insertion, you need a general design, as opposed to
arbitrarily introducing extra code points for one or two signs for this
purpose. There are many signs, perhaps dozens if not hundreds, that change their
appearance depending on whether they are used with or without insertion.
Much more common examples are U+1312A and U+1312B and U+13257
but separate code points for those for the purpose of insertions were not introduced.
</p>
    <p>
See how HieroJax handles these, by selecting appropriate glyphs
depending on insertion:

      <a href="https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax/insertionlist.html">https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax/insertionlist.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
Third, once you have introduced minor graphical variations as core
independent code points, for the purpose of insertions, then you cannot
prevent encoders from using those code points *without* insertions. They
can then try to encode minor variations in dimensions, or just
arbitrarily pick one or the other code point for the same sign. This
helps no one, and is only a nuisance for standardization.

    </p>
    <p>This may be one of the cases where consistency between different fonts will be
impossible to achieve and where it will be impossible for encoders to decide which code point to choose.  The "teardrop sized perch with the point down" *is* an upside down cone. One shape is marginally thinner and longer than the other, that's all.
</p>
    <p>
The Database writes that the cone in U+13C9D should be drawn to be small "to distinguish it from" U+13C9F.
This proves my point. If you need to resort to emphasizing, if not exaggerating, size differences in the normalized font in order
to be able to argue that the two shapes are actually different signs to begin with, then you are just 
inflating the number of code points for the sake of having a lot of code points, or for
the sake of creating palaeographically precise facsimiles for individual tokens. 
The two shapes are functionally equivalent: nb, "lord".
I would challenge anyone to look at the photo of the cited token of U+13C9D in:

and argue that had it not been for the way these two tokens have been transcribed, they would still deem these to be two distinct signs.

unwarranted.

    <p>In the glyph, the feather is angled backwards, and the spear is angled backwards as well (rather than being vertical).
If you want to call the orientation of the spear "vertical", then fine, but then why specify the orientation of the
feather? The descriptions are overly precise, which creates avoidable problems for consistency.
Another thing is that the glyph does have a "handle" on the arrow/harpoon, contrary to the description.

This is a normalized transcription, so this is not necessarily conclusive.

But anyway, who cares?
No doubt one can find tokens where the lines have the same length and tokens where the lengths clearly differ.
Conversely, one can find tokens of U+13192 where top and bottom lines have the same length;
see for example the facsimile on p. 66 (bottom line) of the above publication.

    </p>
    <p>
The transcription has a sun disk, but it would be hard to confirm its existence in the photo.
So it may be best to leave underspecified whether there is a sun disk.
The problem is now that many other descriptions in UniKemet are overspecific and would mention the sun disk
if it is visible in the inscription. I think the only viable way forward is to remove extraneous detail from
the descriptions, so the sign list becomes an actual list of signs rather than a list of tokens.

    <p>What is the difference between "standing up" and "its tail coiled up, in a
single coil"? In the glyphs, it is just the height of the tail that differs
between U+13DAB and U+13DAD, and U+13DAE actually appears to have a tail closer to U+13DAB than to U+13DAD.

Another example where consistency between fonts will be impossible to achieve, and the graphical distinctions that
have been made seem inappropriately fine-grained for Unicode.

    <p>If it is really necessary to distinguish these two (they are functionality
identical and as close as say the hare from the flat hare in appearance), then "lower than"
is insufficient to distinguish U+13DB1 from U+13DB2. In the glyph, the coils are about half the height of the head. If this is accurate, then I would write "about half the height" rather than "lower than".

    <p>What is the difference that justifies the multiple code points for such similar graphical variants? The "head upward" ? Or the exact angle of the knifes?  In fact the head in U+13DBE is less "upward" than in U+13DBB.

(and a nb sign at the bottom); see link below. U+13DE7 is not that.

      <tt>U+13E4B kEH_Desc A flower with four petals in a circle.</tt>
    </p>
    <p>The glyph interprets the shape of U+13E48 differently from the description. 
The glyph is drawn as 7 overlapping heart-shaped petals, while the description sees 7 non-overlapping oval-shaped petals surrounded
by a wavy circle. From the pointer in the Database:
</p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/4081">http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/4081</a>
    </p>
    <p>
I would say the description is right and the glyph is wrong (or at least misleading).
</p>
    <p>
Moreover, the photo shows the token does not have 7 but rather 6 petals, while the transcription has 8 petals! 
This shows once again that having such overly specific descriptions in UniKemet is untenable.
The number 7 is completely arbitrary. It is not part of the character identity. 
It was not dictated by evidence in the form of extant inscriptions, and not even by existing
normalized transcriptions. It so happens that someone at some point drew the glyph with 7 petals, 
and the number 7 was then elevated to a status it doesn't deserve.
Claims that an (over)emphasis on (arbitrary) details is somehow more "scientific" should not be readily accepted.
</p>
    <p>
Changing 7 to 6 in the description won't change anything if the week after 
a token is found which actually has 7 petals.
The one obvious solution is not to include the exact number of petals in the description.
Then the question becomes whether U+13E4B deserves an independent code point.

    <p>Presumably, a "bud" looks different from a "flower". Yet the three things in

    <p>The "near the bottom of the bundle" of U+13EAB doesn't seem to match the glyph.

Also, does adding U+13EAB next to U+131E7 not
violate Point 5 of the Encoding Principles "Signs that exist with and without inner detailing will be included with the inner detailing"?
</p>
    <p>
It is unclear to me what the point was of this sign. The Database has a reference to:
</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA828">https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA828</a>
    </p>
    <p>
which to me seems to have the string nearer to the top of the bundle than to the bottom.
Another example in the Database has the string half-way the bundle.
But who cares about the exact position of the string anyway.
This may be a typical case of overspecificity of the description, which then inevitably results 
in inconsistencies.

</p>
    <p>
My preference would be to underspecify the number of pieces. If the number of rows is significant 
(and I'm not even convinced of this), one can mention that, e.g.:

"A basket with two rows [or layers] of pieces of grain or fruit."

    <p>Adding U+13EB5 next to U+13EB4 seems hardly appropriate for Unicode. 
It appears to be overtly paleographic, and such details are lost in ordinary font sizes and coarse fonts may omit these details anyway.

    <p>In both cases, the lines "extend beyond each other". If the glyphs are accurate, then a different way should be found to phrase the difference between U+13F05 and U+13F06 (and preferably not by counting lines). Is it the orientation of the angles, sloping "forward" or sloping "backward"?

This supports my view that there should not be multiple code points for the same sign with and without "internal details".
Point 5 of the Encoding Principles actually suggests the same.

In the Database I see a comment "I am not sure the variation between the O16 variants (broad vs less broad) is meaninful enough to include in Unicode", but also "Seems too numerous to leave out". The first comment is more than reasonable, but the second comment is moot. 
I'm sure that you will be able to find lots of occurrences of the flat N025A next to the tall N25 (the "foreign land" sign) in encodings, but that doesn't mean that N25 and N025A have independent character identities. If you believe that N025A (U+1320A) was made Legacy for good reasons (and I would agree), then why should U+13F98 and U+13F99 both exist as core signs in Unicode?

    <p>Because I didn't understand how to interpret "triangles" I consulted the link in the Database to:
</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=4590">https://thotsignlist.org/mysign?id=4590</a>
    </p>
    <p>
The TSL currently has 8 tokens of O23, only one of them has triangle-shaped capitals.
This again reveals that a description in UniKemet does not describe a sign, but rather describes one particular, 
arbitrarily chosen, instance of a sign.
It makes very little sense to me that a description would be so specific.
If it is really necessary in Unicode to distinguish columns in pavilions with and without capitals
(which I already find quite a stretch), then specifying the exact shape of the capitals
in my opinion goes too far.
</p>
    <p>
Apropos, it shouldn't be hard to find tokens of this sign that have proper capitals that
don't look like triangles. See for example p. 116 l. 17 of:
</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://archive.org/details/MMAF13f2/page/n47/mode/2up">https://archive.org/details/MMAF13f2/page/n47/mode/2up</a>
    </p>
    <p>
Then there are countless other forms, for example where only two of the four columns 
have capitals (in the shape of "triangles" or otherwise), such as in pl. 218 of:
</p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
It is madness to try to capture all cases by separate code points.
It becomes unavoidable sooner or later to abstract away from tokens, that is,
to have a single code point that covers multiple tokens that differ in discrete ways.

    <p>The glyph and the description are at the very least misleading.
What are supposed to be abaci appear to be drawn as tips of the sky sign.
Also, there is not one base, but rather two bases, one under each column.
This is confirmed by the pointer in the Database:

    <p>
I suggest making the description less ambiguous with regard to the base(s).
It is a legitimate question whether presence/absence of abaci is essential to the character identity in Unicode.
I would ignore them, both in the glyph and in the description.

    </p>
    <p>
The "on top of a base (O210A); on a broad base" should probably be "on top of a broad base" if the
facsimile is accurate. That is, I don't see two bases (one below each column) in addition and on top of the one broad base.
</p>
    <p>
I also don't see abaci in additions to the tips of the sky sign.
Conversely, could it have been that the tips of the sky sign are the abaci?
Why bother mentioning the abaci in the first place? It is a tiny detail and likely not essential to the character identity.

    <p>The Database says "Needs to be atomic due to the position of the O34."
</p>
    <p>
Nonsense, because (1) whether O34 is 1pt higher or lower relative to the legs is paleography, and (2) it is the font's responsibility to arrange signs in a suitable manner. This exact group was in fact listed in:

    </p>
    <p>
If we are starting to encode groups atomically because we wish to fine-tune their exact positioning, then why did we bother with controls in the first place? Controls by definition abstract away from exact positionings. The advantages of controls are normalization and abstraction.  Are we willing to give up on these advantages now?  It makes no sense to on the one hand deprecate clearly distinct graphical variants in the basic list (making them Legacy), motivated by the advantages of normalization and abstraction, while on the other hand introducing new atomic encodings of compositional groups, moving away from normalization.
</p>
    <p>
And if you accept that Unicode needs to encode fine-tuned positioning, then the one or two ligatures that have slipped through in the extended Unicode set will not suffice. You will need to start introducing possibly hundreds of additional code points of compositional groups. I don't think anyone would be happy with that either.

    </p>
    <p>The "crossbar" in U+14041 is not depicted like the crossbar in e.g. U+1403F. Is it that crossbars can look very different?
Or is the glyph of U+14041 wrong?
</p>
    <p>
By the way, is a "crossbar" (U+1403F) the same thing as a "crossbeam" (U+14089)? It looks the same. Perhaps the terminology can be made consistent?

    <p>The description of U+14042 is not nearly as detailed as some others.  For one thing, it doesn't mention the shapes at the ends of the "crescent moon", which are not like other boats, apart from U+14050 perhaps, which has "prow and stern curved inwards".
</p>
    <p>
Another thing is that the "back" is at the left, unlike other boats where the back is at the right. 
It would be good to write in descriptions where prow and stern appear reversed.

    <p>I don't see a doorway in the glyph of U+1404D.
Also, in the vague image I seem to make out the vulture headdress underneath the bovine horns headdress, just like U+13933. Is that real?

    </p>
    <p>
I would interpret the photo as showing a large doorway, but it is uncertain
there is a vulture headdress.
</p>
    <p>
I think that doorways should not be mentioned in the descriptions of facades,
as they are an overly palaeographic detail irrelevant on the level of Unicode,
especially if a facade is a secondary item in a larger graphical composition,
e.g. a facade on a boat.
The fact that there are so many cases where description and glyph are inconsistent when it comes
to absence/presence of doorways confirms this. If half the time it couldn't be correctly specified 
whether there is or is not a doorway, then 
apparently it doesn't matter that much and it isn't part of the identities of signs anyway.
The same could be said about sun disks on uraei, and about hairstyles for most "men" signs,
ankh signs in certain circumstances (see below), and so on.
A fair amount of pointless work would immediately fall away and make life easier
for sign list developers, for font designers, and last but not least for encoders.
What has been done for Unicode 16 is not sustainable.

    <p>I cannot make out the ankh sign. Is it not there, or does it vanish within the image resolution?

    </p>
    <p>
In the printed transcription, I cannot make out an ankh sign either. This is one of many examples
that suggest that there is a good case for not encoding lower-level details, that is, not
mentioning them in the descriptions and not attempting to clearly display them in the glyphs.
For one thing, this should avoid overinterpretation of photos and normalized transcriptions and hallucinating
things that might not be real.

    <p>Why are these not the same sign? "tall" versus "low" is palaeography, and meaningless on the level of Unicode.

I will draw two identical shapes.
Both signs are functionally equivalent, representing the Henu-bark of Sokar.

    </p>
    <p>The glyph suggests *two* oars/rudders.
</p>
    <p>
I would not call the mentioned shape in the glyph a "horizontal rectangle". A rectangle consists of straight lines, while the shape is prominently curved. Perhaps say "flat shape inside between prow and stern with vertical lines as internal decoration"?

In the Database I find comments "For Unicode, I would argue
to only include P5, not any of the many variants (which will be covered in TSL)" and "(P5) will be sufficient for Unicode".
The fact that there are now unresolved issues for U+14086 and for several other "sail" signs vindicates these comments.
Graphical variants that differ in no more than minute details cause endless inconsistencies and misery for
font designers and encoders alike. I don't understand why this sign was included despite these comments in the Database
arguing against it.

    <p>In U+1410B, U+1410C, U+1410D the mentioned things are connected by a line at the bottom. The line is thin in U+1410C while it is thick and prominent in U+1410B and U+1410D. By all reasonable measures, the thickness should not matter as to the character identity. Even if the line is drawn as in U+1410A, it is still just a line. I doubt there are any good reasons for talking about "base" in U+14109 and U+1410A while not even mentioning the connecting line in U+1410B, U+1410C, U+1410D. 
</p>
    <p>
The description of U+14110 does mention "base", while the glyph has just a thick line, just like U+1410B and U+1410D.
</p>
    <p>
My proposal would be to have "on a base" (not "a rectangular base") for all such signs for consistency.

This is a typical case where, if we are not to lose our sanity and blow up the sign list by
gazillions more of uninteresting graphical variants, we should make
the description broader. We could allow a pole on top of the block *or* at the bottom of the block,
we could omit mention of the angle of the feather, etc.
That is, we should be moving towards an actual sign list rather than a token list.

    <p>I cannot match this to the glyph at all. Where is the "an uraeus, with a sun disk on the head"?
The Database points to p. 169 l. 4 of:

Apart from the two uraei hanging down, there are no additional uraei,
so I assume the description is wrong.

    <p>
It is also easy to misinterpret "two ureai hanging downwards from the horns at either side";
there are examples (at least in iconography) where four uraei in total, two on each side, 
are hanging from the Atef crowns,

The transcription does not have sun disks, while the photo of the heavily eroded inscription could potentially
be interpreted to have sun disks.
There is another token that (in normalized transcription) does have sun disks, namely p. 169 l. 3 of:

    <p>
The main thing is that glyph and description are consistent. Adding sun disks to the
glyph seems the most straightforward way to achieve this in this instance.
But more generally, one should seriously consider not encoding low-level details at all, i.e. not
mentioning them in descriptions and not trying to visibly render them in glyphs, to circumvent
problems that are inherently unsolvable.

The Database has "although this form will suffice for Unicode,
in reality the sign from the source is a lot more elaborate".
Then why does the description not describe "this form"? For font designers and encoders alike it creates
unsolvable problems if example glyphs and descriptions are mutually inconsistent.

    <p>How are there sickle shapes? To me, U+132EF and U+141AF look identical except that one is slightly wider than the other, which is generally not a good enough reason to introduce multiple code points.
</p>
    <p>
The Encoding Principles have under point 2:
</p>
    <p>
"Chubby or slender signs are part of this continuum and will not be
differentiated."
TSL has one atypical token TSL_3_20841, and I wonder whether that was the one that was thought to have "sickle shapes":

    </p>
    <p>
The Database has "Not a meaningful variant". I would agree. Perhaps TSL_3_20841 is just a one-off, clumsily carved instance of the kilt,
rather than an independent shape. But then why was it added?

    <p>I count seven fringes in the glyph. The most obvious solution is to abstract away from the exact number.
The description could have "with six or more fringes". That there is a code point specifically for
five fringes is already far-fetched.

One cannot keep extending the sign list as if it were a list of tokens. A sign list is a list of types,
a type being an abstraction of one or more tokens.

    <p>A square is a special case of a rectangle such that the width and height are exactly the same. 
The fringes of U+141BF and U+141C0 are comparably long, drawn slightly differently but so what?
It doesn't seem appropriate to me that such shapes would be distinguished in Unicode (cf. again the Encoding Principles).
</p>
    <p>
The Database says of U+141BF that it is "[n]ot a meaningful variant of [U+132F7]"; but note that the shape of
U+132F7 in Unicode 16 has sloping fringes, whereas the intended shape in Unicode 5.2 is non-sloping.
I see no reflection in the Database on what the core difference between U+141BF and U+141C0 is supposed to be.

    </p>
    <p>I see no "loop" in U+14214, nor in U+14217.
For U+14214 the Database refers to:

    <p>
      <a href="http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/4205">http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/4205</a>
    </p>
    <p>
The inscription is rather eroded, but it seems a reasonable guess to interpret the sign as having
a "loop" as in the description, rather than a diagonal beam.
For U+14217 the Database refers to p. 94, l. 6 of:
</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://archive.org/details/MMAF25/page/n59/mode/2up">https://archive.org/details/MMAF25/page/n59/mode/2up</a>
    </p>
    <p>
Here the transcription has a "loop" as well instead of the diagonal beam, confirming the description.
</p>
    <p>
Even before, the Database had for U+14216: "I am not sure if it is that valuable for Unicode".
After correcting the glyphs of U+14214 and U+14217, 
U+14216 becomes basically a duplicate of U+14214, and there should be even less reason for it to
exist.

    <p>"sun within a halo" suggests there should be an "inner circle". I don't see that in the glyph. (But frankly, who cares about such fiddly details. Something like "sun encircled by a cobra" is precise enough. Or just N6.)

    </p>
    <p>"At the front" in the description of U+1429D becomes confusing because the sign is mirrored relative to say U+1429C. 
(I assume the mirroring is intentional.) 
Elsewhere in descriptions I have seen use of "left" and "right". I realise the downside of left/right is that strictly speaking this becomes incorrect for right-to-left running text, but the left/right terminology tends to be less ambiguous than front/back when describing signs in the sign list.
</p>
    <p>
Apropos, what I find puzzling in this and many other cases is that only negative views are entered in the Database, here
"variation too limited to be of use for Unicode" and "Not a meaningful variant". And yet it became not only a new code point but
a core sign?

In the Database there is a comment:
</p>
    <p>
"Variation seems meaningless to me. I would not even include it as a class in TSL."

Quite! How this then became a new code point, let alone a core sign, is a mystery to me.

    </p>
    <p>To me, "square" implies 4 corners.  If this was meant to contrast U+142DB with say U+142DC, then perhaps replace "square-bottomed" by "flat-bottomed"?

    </p>
    <p>The vertical line is interrupted by the base. That seems inconsistent with the description. Is the glyph incorrect or should the description be amended?
</p>
    <p>
Also, I would replace "coming from" by "on".

    <p>Again, is the vertical line in U+142F7 supposed to be interrupted at the base? There isn't actually a vertical line between the two ovals, it looks more like there is whitespace between the two ovals.
</p>
    <p>
U+142F7 has "upwards dot"? I would not describe the shape in the glyph as a dot. It looks more like U22 (U+1334A).

    </p>
    <p>
It would be impossible to see a beard in the coarse font of the inscription and in the blurry
photo (at least in the online PDF).
Where does the idea come from that there is a beard?
There would not have been a problem had undue specificity in the description been avoided.

In the photo, the shape in fact occurs twice,
once as part of running text and once in iconography, and in both cases there is a pronounced stroke under the egg.

From Unicode 17, this has been addressed by adding "stroke shaped like an eyebrow" to the description.

      <tt>U+13393 kEH_Desc A cobra in repose (Naja haja) (I10), written over a hobble for cattle without a crossbar (V20).</tt>
    </p>
    <p>In the glyph of U+1432F, it is not "written over" as it is usually interpreted.
</p>
    <p>
Further, the introduction of this code point next to U+13393, or at all, is poorly justified.
The Database has:
</p>
    <p>
"Seems to occur when the
text is arranged to fit something as if it is a normal I10. If used in this capacity, it needs to be atomic." 
</p>
    <p>
The "fit something as if [...]" is too vague. What I understand from the pointer in the Database to:
</p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/4225">http://sith.huma-num.fr/karnak/4225</a>
    </p>
    <p>
is that the intended use of U+1432F is with insertion in the bottom left corner.
But as noted before, the implementation can choose an appropriate form of an overlay depending
on whether there are insertions, obviating the need for U+1432F (and of U+13393 for that matter).
</p>
    <p>
Once again, I note that e.g. the flat hare U+130FA and the flat swallow U+1316B, which are typically used
with vertical joiners, were deprecated because they "only" served to arrange signs in a better way.
And yet the only justification for the introduction of U+1432F is that it serves to arrange signs
in a better way.
There is no coherent vision behind what was done.
