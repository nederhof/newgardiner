    <h1>Comments on the extended list in Unicode 16</h1>
    <p>The glyphs of the extended list were automatically extracted from the official PDF code charts of Unicode 16. For the basic list, the glyphs are from the code charts of Unicode 5.2. Lines in blue starting with code point and kEH_Desc are descriptions copied verbatim from Unikemet.</p>

    </p>
    <p>This may be one of the cases where consistency between different fonts will be
impossible to achieve and where it will be impossible for the encoders to know which code point to choose.  The "teardrop sized perch with the point down" *is* an upside down cone. One shape is marginally thinner and longer than the other, that's all.

    </p>
    <p>The "one wing forward" is not remotely "horizontal" in the glyph. If the glyph is accurate, I would just say "wings forward, one slanting up and the other slanting down", avoiding also mention of the exact angle. [I'm not sure the word "slanting" is the most fluent English word one could choose.]

The glyph of U+13CDA, unlike U+13CD9, seems to suggest uraei on the headdress. Are those real?

    <p>What is the difference between "standing up" and "its tail coiled up, in a
single coil"? In the glyphs, it is just the height of the tail that differs
between U+13DAB and U+13DAD, and U+13DAE actually appears to have a tail closer to U+13DAB than to U+13DAD.

have been made seem inappropriately fine-grained for Unicode.

    <p>If it is really necessary to distinguish these two (they are functionality
identical and as close as say the hare from the flat hare in appearance), then "lower than"
is insufficient to distinguish U+13DB1 from U+13DB2. In the glyph, the coils are about half the height of the head. If this is accurate, then I would write "about half the height" rather than "lower than".

    <p>What is the difference that justifies the multiple code points for such similar graphical variants? The "head upward" ? Or the exact angle of the knifes?  In fact the head in U+13DBE is less "upward" than in U+13DBB.

be subtle and variable and often encoders need to rely more on function than

    <p>In the glyph, the wings are not remotely connected and I would not even say the wings make a circular form.  I think I know what is meant by "circular form", e.g. the winged scarab pectoral of Tutankhamun has a full circular form with the sun disk in between at the top (and a nb sign at the bottom). U+13DE7 is not that.

    <p>In both cases, the lines "extend beyond each other". If the glyphs are accurate, then a different way should be found to phrase the difference between U+13F05 and U+13F06 (and preferably not by counting lines). Is it the orientation of the angles, sloping "forward" or sloping "backward"?

    <p>The two listed functions happen to be different, but unless the two functions are actually tied to the width difference, then this is not a meaningful distinction for Unicode, and consistency between fonts will be impossible to achieve.
</p>
    <p>
In the "database" I see a comment "I am not sure the variation between the O16 variants (broad vs less broad) is meaninful enough to include in Unicode", but also "Seems too numerous to leave out". I understand the first, but the second is moot. I'm sure that you will be able to find lots of occurrences of the flat N025A next to the tall N25 (the "foreign land" sign) in encodings, but that doesn't mean that N25 and N025A have independent character identities. If you believe that N025A (U+1320A) was made Legacy for good reasons (and I would agree), then why should U+13F98 and U+13F99 both exist as core signs in Unicode?

    <p>This distinction is so silly that even the number of vertical lines in the
glyph of U+13FA1 is wrong (it is four in the glyph, not three).
</p>
    <p>
Understandably, in the Database we find:
</p>
    <p>
"I could not verify any token with an glyph, and for Unicode only F2ED7 (O329A) OR F2EDA (O329) should be added, not both."
</p>
    <p>
Was it a mistake then that both U+13FA1 and U+13FA2 ended up being added to Unicode as core signs?

    <p>The description of U+13FD6 is not at all what the glyph shows. The glyph has the sky sign where I would expect two abaci (one abacus on top of each column, if I understand what an abacus is). Also, there is not one base, but rather two bases, one under each column.  How I interpret the description of U+13FD6 is as U+13FC1 but without the carrying chair.

The abaci are not shown in the glyph. (Why bother mentioning the abaci in the

    <p>The Database says "Needs to be atomic due to the position of the O34."
</p>
    <p>
Nonsense, because (1) whether O34 is 1pt higher or lower relative to the legs is paleography, and (2) it is the font's responsibility to arrange signs in a suitable manner. This exact group was in fact listed in:
</p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
If we are starting to encode groups atomically because we wish to fine-tune their exact positioning, then why did we bother with controls in the first place? Controls by definition abstract away from exact positionings. The advantages of controls are normalization and abstraction.  Are we willing to give up on these advantages now?  It makes no sense to on the one hand deprecate clearly distinct graphical variants in the basic list (making them Legacy), motivated by the advantages of normalization and abstraction, while on the other hand introducing new atomic encodings of compositional groups, moving away from normalization.
</p>
    <p>
And if you accept that Unicode needs to encode fine-tuned positioning, then the one or two ligatures that have slipped through in the extended Unicode set will not suffice. You will need to start introducing possibly hundreds of additional code points of compositional groups. I don't think anyone would be happy with that either.

Another thing is that the "back" is apparently at the left, unlike other boats where the back is at the right. Is that intentional?

    <p>It is hard to imagine a more blatant, more literal violation of Point 5 of the
Guidelines:
</p>
    <p>
"Signs that exist with and without inner detailing will be included with the inner detailing"
</p>
    <p>
Most of the Guidelines use weasel words that allow unlimited proliferation of
variant shapes despite giving the impression of wanting to keep the number of
variant shapes within reasonable bounds. If even one of the clearer guidelines
is so flagrantly broken, then what is the point of having the guidelines in the first place?

    <p>The glyph suggests *two* oars/rudders.

I would not call the mentioned shape in the glyph a "horizontal rectangle". A rectangle consists of straight lines, while the shape is prominently curved. Perhaps say "flat shape inside between prow and stern with vertical lines as internal decoration"?

    <p>In U+1410B, U+1410C, U+1410D the mentioned things are connected by a line at the bottom. The line is thin in U+1410C while it is thick and prominent in U+1410B and U+1410D. By all reasonable measures, the thickness should not matter as to the identity of the sign. Even if the line is drawn as in U+1410A, it is still just a line. I doubt there are any good reasons for talking about "base" in U+14109 and U+1410A while not even mentioning the connecting line in U+1410B, U+1410C, U+1410D. 
</p>
    <p>
The description of U+14110 does mention "base", while the glyph has just a thick line, just like U+1410B and U+1410D.
</p>
    <p>
My proposal would be to have "on a base" (not "a rectangular base") for all such signs for consistency.

    <p>If the circle section is to represent a crescent moon, then the glyph doesn't do a very good of representing this, i.e. it is nothing like N11 as it occurs in most fonts.

    <p>I see no "loop" in U+14214. If a loop is added, then U+14214 and U+14216 become basically the same shape. Not sure how the diagonal part of the standard fits in.

    <p>"At the front" in the description of U+1429D becomes confusing because the sign is mirrored relative to say U+1429C. Elsewhere in descriptions I have seen use of "left" and "right". I realise the downside of left/right is that strictly speaking this becomes incorrect for right-to-left running text, but the left/right terminology tends to be less ambiguous than front/back when describing signs in the sign list.

    <p>In the Unicode 5.2 code charts (not the current code charts), the handle of U+13349 was already a little below the wood.  Either way, distinguishing these two variants on the basis of how many pixels the handle is below the wood is entirely inappropriate for Unicode.

In the Database there is a comment:
</p>
    <p>
"Variation seems meaningless to me. I would not even include it as a class in TSL."

    <p>
Quite! How this then became a new code point, let alone a core sign, is a mystery to me.

    </p>
    <p>I suspect the "horizontal line on top of the forked drill-bit" should have distinguished these two, but
it is missing from U+142C5. Without this, the signs are identical for all practical purposes.

    <p>The vertical line is interrupted by the base. That seems inconsistent with the description. Is the glyph incorrect or should the description be amended?

    <p>Again, is the vertical line in U+142F7 supposed to be interrupted at the base? There isn't actually a vertical line between the two ovals, it looks more like there is whitespace between the two ovals.
</p>
    <p>
U+142F7 has "upwards dot"? The shape in the glyph is not like a dot. It looks more like U22 (U+1334A).
