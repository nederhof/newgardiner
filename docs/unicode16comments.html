    <h1>Comments on the extended list in Unicode 16</h1>
    <p>The glyphs of the extended list were automatically extracted from the official PDF code charts of Unicode 16. For the basic list, the glyphs are from the code charts of Unicode 5.2. Lines in blue starting with code point and kEH_Desc are descriptions copied verbatim from Unikemet. Comments in green indicate that the issues were resolved.</p>

    <p>I feel "both" places an unnecessary and misleading emphasis on the plurality of "knees", because only one knee is visible after all. Can "both" be omitted?

    <p>The "left foot horizontal" in the description of U+13473 suggest its glyph is wrong and should be
like the position of the feet in U+13462.

    <p>The "front arm" is quite confusing. It is not the arm closest to the reader (I guess) but the arm connected to the shoulder closest to an
imaginary person facing the man. Why not just "left arm" to disambiguate?

    <p>
"Man, standing, back bent forwards, arms raised on either side of the body, bent at the elbow, hands at the height of the shoulders, holding an oar with both hands at 45° with the blade downwards."
</p>
    <p>
If the oar is at 45 degrees, and the hands are both on the oar, then the hands cannot both be at the height of the shoulders. I think the description tries to be overly precise, to the point of no longer making sense. I would omit "hands at the height of the shoulders".

    <p>The glyph has left and right hands switched around. It is a legitimate question whether the description needs to be this precise.
Something like "hands holding a two-pronged mast [...]" would be perfectly adequate.

    <p>The description of x13584 has "bent slightly forwards" while the description of U+13585 does not.
Yet, apart from the position of the left arm, the poses in the two glyphs are 100% identical.
If it is necessary to so precisely describe the pose, then at least make sure that the glyphs
reflect what the descriptions say.

Should that matter? If not, then fine, and I assume that font designers are free to
treat the two variants as interchangeable. But then I see a problem in that on other occasions,
multiple code points were introduced for the same underlying sign, depending on the variant of standard;
e.g. U+1315D versus U+13C5D. There appears to be no consistency.

the glyph of U+136C7 in Unicode 17 no longer depicts a uraeus. It needs to be double-checked
with the philologists what the intention was.
</p>
    <p>
Incidentally, U+136C6 was reportedly not meant to become a core sign in Unicode 16, 
but is still marked as core sign in Unicode 17.

    <p>
Remove "a" from "with a leonid legs".

    <p>In the glyph of U+136FF, the hands don't appear to be "in a clapping motion". I imagine that for this, 
one would at least have to have the hand palms directed towards one another,
as they are in U+13736 for example.

    <p>In all four glyphs, only one lower leg is visible. But why on earth should we care whether 
one or two legs are visible and whether the legs are separated (unless we are engaged in hard-core palaeographic studies, 
which are outside the domain of Unicode)? I would suggest omitting "lower legs separated".

    <p>I would leave it at "hand palms upwards". The "hands horizontal" is not consistent with the glyph and that the hands are "half-way" horizontal is already implied by "hand palms upwards".
You are doing a grave disservice to users of Unicode by feeding them inconsistent information.
In particular, you are making the job of font designers impossible.
If you cannot ensure that the glyph in the code charts
is consistent with the description, then there is no point making the description so specific.

    <p>The hands in the glyph are not horizontal by any stretch of the imagination. I would leave it at "hand palms downwards", which probably
implies what was meant.
</p>
    <p>
Further, the glyph does a poor job of depicting that hair is hanging in front of the face. I would like to see a drawing of what this is supposed to look like. Are the eyes and mouth occluded from view by the hair?

    <p>The description in the draft Unicode 17 version is inconsistent as to whether there is a lump of clay or a vessel:
it has both "with a lump of clay on it" and "hands at the vessel".

    </p>
    <p>In the glyph, the left hand is not at the wheel, it is at the vessel. The right foot is not really at the base of the wheel. But who cares! Does the description need to be so precise? It could be simplified like the description of U+13817 was simplified recently.

    <p>Unicode 17 will make the glyph consistent with the description by letting the god touch the wall.

    </p>
    <p>No arm is visible in the glyph. My suggestion is to replace "arm forward, forearm following the angle of the upper leg, hand on the knee, horizontally, handpalm up, supporting" by simply "holding". Overly precise descriptions tend to be inconsistent with the glyphs
in the code charts. And anyway, who cares. The character identity could be captured by as little as "Seated ibis-headed god holding face".

    <p>The glyph does suggests a sun disk (in the middle above the horns). This has been confirmed to be an error.
In Unicode 17 one of the circles on the crown will be removed, but it is regrettably the wrong circle; the circle
on top of the crown should remain.

    <p>The "circle" in U+138F9 looks perfectly identical to the "round vessel" from U+138F8.
If it is really just a circle (representing the sun?) and not a round vessel, then make sure it is perfectly round in the glyph.

    </p>
    <p>Treating U+139FE and U+139FF as distinct from U+130AB strays well into the realm of
palaeography, which is normally considered to be outside the scope of Unicode.
The Database mentions for both U+139FE and U+139FF "Exists, but would already be covered by [...] U+130AB", but offers
no further justification why these two became core signs nonetheless.
</p>
    <p>
For U+139FF in particular, it seems hard to defend the length of the thumb as a reason to introduce a new code point.
For U+139FE, I don't really consider the thumb to be "upward" any more than in U+130AB; one slightly more obvious
graphical difference is that the egg is held at an angle in U+139FE, but the description does not
mention the angle of the egg as significant.
It would be hard to argue moreover that the hieroglyphic depiction of an "egg" and an "oval" are distinct.
Functionally, the signs are equivalent.

For U+139C9 I'm also not sure how to interpret "angled forwards".

    <p>I don't think that the glyph of 13AAE has the head of a jackal. The beak looks more like a falcon (although there are ears). 
Conversely, 13AAF doesn't look like it has the head of a falcon, and I think normally a griffin has the head of a falcon. Are the descriptions reversed?
</p>
    <p>
The glyph of U+13AAE does correspond to JSesh E80A and the glyph of U+13AAF does correspond to JSesh E80, so in 
this respect, Unikemet appears to be accurate.

    <p>In the Database I find:
</p>
    <p>
"overlay, but likely to difficult to render correctly with overlay tools."
</p>
    <p>
Wanting to get the appearance to be "perfect" is generally a pretty bad reason to include composed signs as atomic code points, and if you were to follow the same reasoning consistently you would need to include many dozens if not hundreds of composed signs, not just for overlays but also for insertions.  Even for the vertical joiner, one could make the appearance more "perfect" if a hare becomes flatter, which is why Gardiner had E034A (U+130FA) in his font. But E034A was deprecated (made legacy) for good reasons!
</p>
    <p>
HieroJax already has provisions to fine-tune the appearance of overlays, insertions and more. Cf.
</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax/ligaturelist.html">https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax/ligaturelist.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
It appears to be an internally inconsistent strategy to deprecate existing composed signs in the basic sign list like U+131A5 for nsw-bjtj (which is actually pretty difficult to get "perfect" if encoded compositionally) while introducing new composed signs in the extended sign list.
</p>
    <p>
For nsw-bjtj see Points 9 and 10 of the Encoding Principles in:
</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr57/tr57-4.html">https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr57/tr57-4.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
In particular under Point 10:
</p>
    <p>
"However, exceptions can be made for signs which are widely used"
</p>
    <p>
I would say that if exceptions can be made, then nsw-bjtj is a reasonable candidate for an exception. But U+13B88 and U+13B89 and U+13B8B are not.

      <tt>U+13125 kEH_Desc A windpipe and lungs.</tt>
    </p>
    <p>I understand that U+13BDF was introduced as a variant of U+13125 mainly for the use with insertions. This is a terrible
idea, for at least three reasons.
</p>
    <p>
First, it assumes that a font cannot detect whether a sign is used with
or without an insertion and then automatically select an appropriate
glyph for that sign. For HieroJax that is absolutely not the case and I
cannot imagine that it is a problem for OpenType either. The task of
placing an inserted group in the correct position, and scaling it
appropriately, is several orders of magnitude more difficult than simply
detecting co-occurrence of two characters.
</p>
    <p>
Second, even if you assume that font technology is incapable of
selecting the most appropriate glyph depending on whether or not it is
used with insertion, you need a general design, as opposed to
arbitrarily introducing extra code points for one or two signs for this
purpose. There are many signs, perhaps dozens if not hundreds, that change their
appearance depending on whether they are used with or without insertion.
Much more common examples are U+1312A and U+1312B and U+13257
but separate code points for those for the purpose of insertions were not introduced.
</p>
    <p>
See how HieroJax handles these, by selecting appropriate glyphs
depending on insertion:
</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax/insertionlist.html">https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax/insertionlist.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
Third, once you have introduced minor graphical variations as core
independent code points, for the purpose of insertions, then you cannot
prevent encoders from using those code points *without* insertions. They
can then try to encode minor variations in dimensions, or just
arbitrarily pick one or the other code point for the same sign. This
helps no one, and is only a nuisance for standardization.

    <p>None of the descriptions of human-headed birds mention beards. If these are not expected to have beards, or if it doesn't matter, I would suggest omitting them from the glyphs.

The glyph of U+13CDA, unlike U+13CD9, seems to suggest uraei on the headdress. Are those real?

    <p>What is the difference between "standing up" and "its tail coiled up, in a
single coil"? In the glyphs, it is just the height of the tail that differs
between U+13DAB and U+13DAD, and U+13DAE actually appears to have a tail closer to U+13DAB than to U+13DAD.

Another example where consistency between fonts will be impossible to achieve, and the graphical distinctions that
have been made seem inappropriately fine-grained for Unicode.

    <p>If it is really necessary to distinguish these two (they are functionality
identical and as close as say the hare from the flat hare in appearance), then "lower than"
is insufficient to distinguish U+13DB1 from U+13DB2. In the glyph, the coils are about half the height of the head. If this is accurate, then I would write "about half the height" rather than "lower than".

Here the shape in the normalized font looks like that in Unicode, 
but the image of the token more plausibly looks like the description, with a rounded "hole".

    <p>What is the difference that justifies the multiple code points for such similar graphical variants? The "head upward" ? Or the exact angle of the knifes?  In fact the head in U+13DBE is less "upward" than in U+13DBB.

be subtle and variable and often encoders need to rely more on function than

"A parcel of land with irrigation ditches, at right angles."

      <tt>U+13F06 kEH_Desc A parcel of land with irrigation ditches, consisting of three by three lines, extending beyond each other.</tt>
    </p>
    <p>In both cases, the lines "extend beyond each other". If the glyphs are accurate, then a different way should be found to phrase the difference between U+13F05 and U+13F06 (and preferably not by counting lines). Is it the orientation of the angles, sloping "forward" or sloping "backward"?
</p>

    <p>The two listed functions happen to be different, but unless the two functions are actually tied to the width difference, then this is not a meaningful distinction for Unicode, and consistency between fonts will be impossible to achieve.

In the "database" I see a comment "I am not sure the variation between the O16 variants (broad vs less broad) is meaninful enough to include in Unicode", but also "Seems too numerous to leave out". I understand the first, but the second is moot. I'm sure that you will be able to find lots of occurrences of the flat N025A next to the tall N25 (the "foreign land" sign) in encodings, but that doesn't mean that N25 and N025A have independent character identities. If you believe that N025A (U+1320A) was made Legacy for good reasons (and I would agree), then why should U+13F98 and U+13F99 both exist as core signs in Unicode?

    <p>The description of U+13FD6 is not at all what the glyph shows. The glyph has the sky sign where I would expect two abaci (one abacus on top of each column, if I understand what an abacus is). Also, there is not one base, but rather two bases, one under each column.  How I interpret the description of U+13FD6 is as U+13FC1 but without the carrying chair.

    <p>I would simplify "on top of a base (O210A); on a broad base" to "on top of a broad base (O210A)". Unless I misunderstand what is meant.

The abaci are not shown in the glyph. (Why bother mentioning the abaci in the
first place? It is a tiny detail and likely not essential to the character identity.)

    <p>The Database says "Needs to be atomic due to the position of the O34."
</p>
    <p>
Nonsense, because (1) whether O34 is 1pt higher or lower relative to the legs is paleography, and (2) it is the font's responsibility to arrange signs in a suitable manner. This exact group was in fact listed in:

    </p>
    <p>
If we are starting to encode groups atomically because we wish to fine-tune their exact positioning, then why did we bother with controls in the first place? Controls by definition abstract away from exact positionings. The advantages of controls are normalization and abstraction.  Are we willing to give up on these advantages now?  It makes no sense to on the one hand deprecate clearly distinct graphical variants in the basic list (making them Legacy), motivated by the advantages of normalization and abstraction, while on the other hand introducing new atomic encodings of compositional groups, moving away from normalization.
</p>
    <p>
And if you accept that Unicode needs to encode fine-tuned positioning, then the one or two ligatures that have slipped through in the extended Unicode set will not suffice. You will need to start introducing possibly hundreds of additional code points of compositional groups. I don't think anyone would be happy with that either.

    <p>The description of U+14042 is not nearly as detailed as some others.  For one thing, it doesn't mention the shapes at the ends of the "crescent moon", which are not like other boats, apart from U+14050 perhaps, which has "prow and stern curved inwards".
</p>

Another thing is that the "back" is apparently at the left, unlike other boats where the back is at the right. Is that intentional?

    </p>
    <p>In U+1410B, U+1410C, U+1410D the mentioned things are connected by a line at the bottom. The line is thin in U+1410C while it is thick and prominent in U+1410B and U+1410D. By all reasonable measures, the thickness should not matter as to the identity of the sign. Even if the line is drawn as in U+1410A, it is still just a line. I doubt there are any good reasons for talking about "base" in U+14109 and U+1410A while not even mentioning the connecting line in U+1410B, U+1410C, U+1410D. 
</p>
    <p>
The description of U+14110 does mention "base", while the glyph has just a thick line, just like U+1410B and U+1410D.
</p>
    <p>
My proposal would be to have "on a base" (not "a rectangular base") for all such signs for consistency.

    </p>
    <p>"At the front" in the description of U+1429D becomes confusing because the sign is mirrored relative to say U+1429C. Elsewhere in descriptions I have seen use of "left" and "right". I realise the downside of left/right is that strictly speaking this becomes incorrect for right-to-left running text, but the left/right terminology tends to be less ambiguous than front/back when describing signs in the sign list.

      <tt>U+13349 kEH_Desc An adze, with an attached blade at the front (U19A), in a piece of wood.</tt>
    </p>
    <p>In the Unicode 5.2 code charts (not the Unicode 16 code charts), the handle of U+13349 was already a little below the wood.  Either way, distinguishing these two variants on the basis of how many pixels the handle is below the wood is entirely inappropriate for Unicode.

In the Database there is a comment:
</p>
    <p>
"Variation seems meaningless to me. I would not even include it as a class in TSL."
</p>
    <p>
Quite! How this then became a new code point, let alone a core sign, is a mystery to me.

    </p>
    <p>I suspect the "horizontal line on top of the forked drill-bit" should have distinguished these two, but
it is missing from the glyph of U+142C5. Without this, the signs are identical for all practical purposes.

    <p>To me, "square" implies 4 corners.  If this was meant to contrast U+142DB with say U+142DC, then perhaps replace "square-bottomed" by "flat-bottomed"?

    </p>
    <p>The vertical line is interrupted by the base. That seems inconsistent with the description. Is the glyph incorrect or should the description be amended?

Also, I would replace "coming from" by "on".

    <p>Again, is the vertical line in U+142F7 supposed to be interrupted at the base? There isn't actually a vertical line between the two ovals, it looks more like there is whitespace between the two ovals.
</p>
    <p>
U+142F7 has "upwards dot"? I would not describe the shape in the glyph as a dot. It looks more like U22 (U+1334A).
