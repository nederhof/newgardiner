    <h1>Comments on the extended list in Unicode 16</h1>
    <p>The glyphs of the extended list were automatically extracted from the official PDF code charts of Unicode 16. For the basic list, the glyphs are from the code charts of Unicode 5.2. Lines in blue starting with code point and kEH_Desc are descriptions copied verbatim from Unikemet. Comments in green indicate that the issues were resolved.</p>

    </p>
    <p>In the glyph of U+136C7, there is something that looks like a headrest, not mentioned in the description,
although the description does mention a "long straight beard", which might have been misinterpreted as
headrest when the glyph was created.
The headrest was confirmed to be an error, and will be removed from the glyph in Unicode 17.
But now the Unicode 17 glyph also doesn't have a beard, whereas the beard is still mentioned
in the description.
</p>
    <p>
Further, what appears to be a uraeus in U+136C6 is reportedly an error and will be removed in Unicode 17.
The description of U+136C7 in Unicode 17 still mentions a uraeus, while
the glyph of U+136C7 in Unicode 17 no longer depicts a uraeus. It needs to be double-checked
with the philologists what the intention was.
</p>
    <p>
Incidentally, U+136C6 was reportedly not meant to become a core sign in Unicode 16, 
but is still marked as core sign in Unicode 17.

    <p>Treating U+139FE and U+139FF as distinct from U+130AB strays well into the realm of
palaeography, which is normally considered to be outside the scope of Unicode.
The Database mentions for both U+139FE and U+139FF "Exists, but would already be covered by [...] U+130AB", but offers
no further justification why these two became core signs nonetheless.
</p>
    <p>
For U+139FF in particular, it seems hard to defend the length of the thumb as a reason to introduce a new code point.
For U+139FE, I don't really consider the thumb to be "upward" any more than in U+130AB; one slightly more obvious
graphical difference is that the egg is held at an angle in U+139FE, but the description does not
mention the angle of the egg as significant.
It would be hard to argue moreover that the hieroglyphic depiction of an "egg" and an "oval" are distinct.
Functionally, the signs are equivalent.

"overlay, but likely to difficult to render correctly with overlay tools."
</p>
    <p>
Wanting to get the appearance to be "perfect" is generally a pretty bad reason to include composed signs as atomic code points, and if you were to follow the same reasoning consistently you would need to include many dozens if not hundreds of composed signs, not just for overlays but also for insertions.  Even for the vertical joiner, one could make the appearance more "perfect" if a hare becomes flatter, which is why Gardiner had E034A (U+130FA) in his font. But E034A was deprecated (made legacy) for good reasons!
</p>
    <p>
HieroJax already has provisions to fine-tune the appearance of overlays, insertions and more. Cf.
</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax/ligaturelist.html">https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax/ligaturelist.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
It appears to be an internally inconsistent strategy to deprecate existing composed signs in the basic sign list like U+131A5 for nsw-bjtj (which is actually pretty difficult to get "perfect" if encoded compositionally) while introducing new composed signs in the extended sign list.
</p>
    <p>
For nsw-bjtj see Points 9 and 10 of the Encoding Principles in:
</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr57/tr57-4.html">https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr57/tr57-4.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
In particular under Point 10:
</p>
    <p>
"However, exceptions can be made for signs which are widely used"
</p>
    <p>
I would say that if exceptions can be made, then nsw-bjtj is a reasonable candidate for an exception. But U+13B88 and U+13B89 and U+13B8B are not.

      <tt>U+13125 kEH_Desc A windpipe and lungs.</tt>
    </p>
    <p>I understand that U+13BDF was introduced as a variant of U+13125 mainly for the use with insertions. This is a terrible
idea, for at least three reasons.
</p>
    <p>
First, it assumes that a font cannot detect whether a sign is used with
or without an insertion and then automatically select an appropriate
glyph for that sign. For HieroJax that is absolutely not the case and I
cannot imagine that it is a problem for OpenType either. The task of
placing an inserted group in the correct position, and scaling it
appropriately, is several orders of magnitude more difficult than simply
detecting co-occurrence of two characters.
</p>
    <p>
Second, even if you assume that font technology is incapable of
selecting the most appropriate glyph depending on whether or not it is
used with insertion, you need a general design, as opposed to
arbitrarily introducing extra code points for one or two signs for this
purpose. There are many signs, perhaps dozens if not hundreds, that change their
appearance depending on whether they are used with or without insertion.
Much more common examples are U+1312A and U+1312B and U+13257
but separate code points for those for the purpose of insertions were not introduced.
</p>
    <p>
See how HieroJax handles these, by selecting appropriate glyphs
depending on insertion:
</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax/insertionlist.html">https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax/insertionlist.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
Third, once you have introduced minor graphical variations as core
independent code points, for the purpose of insertions, then you cannot
prevent encoders from using those code points *without* insertions. They
can then try to encode minor variations in dimensions, or just
arbitrarily pick one or the other code point for the same sign. This
helps no one, and is only a nuisance for standardization.

between U+13DAB and U+13DAD, and U+13DAE actually appears to have a tail closer to U+13DAB than to U+13DAD.

identical and as close as say the hare from the flat hare in appearance), then "lower than"
is insufficient to distinguish U+13DB1 from U+13DB2. In the glyph, the coils are about half the height of the head. If this is accurate, then I would write "about half the height" rather than "lower than".

    <p>What is the difference that justifies the multiple code points for such similar graphical variants? The "head upward" ? Or the exact angle of the knifes?  In fact the head in U+13DBE is less "upward" than in U+13DBB.
</p>
    <p>
Once again I'm astonished that clearly distinct graphical variants among the basic list have been made Legacy, while almost indistinguishable variants were introduced as core signs.

    <p>I appreciate the fishes are difficult, because the graphical distinctions can
be subtle and variable and often encoders need to rely more on function than
on appearance, but even so, the above is a problem because the description of
U+13DD3 subsumes that of U+13DD5 and the functions are identical. If U+13DD5
is characterized by particular fins, then U+13DD3 deserves to be characterized by particular (other) fins as well.

U+13DE7 is not that.

    <p>In both cases, the lines "extend beyond each other". If the glyphs are accurate, then a different way should be found to phrase the difference between U+13F05 and U+13F06 (and preferably not by counting lines). Is it the orientation of the angles, sloping "forward" or sloping "backward"?

    <p>There is no attempt to specify what the "internal details" consist of. I can understand why, as it would be pretty hard to specify what that even means.  Should any strokes or texture, no matter how insignificant, be seen as "internal detail"? This supports my view that there should not be multiple code points for the same sign with and without "internal details".
Point 5 of the Encoding Principles actually suggests the same.

    <p>The two listed functions happen to be different, but unless the two functions are actually tied to the width difference, then this is not a meaningful distinction for Unicode, and consistency between fonts will be impossible to achieve.
</p>
    <p>
In the "database" I see a comment "I am not sure the variation between the O16 variants (broad vs less broad) is meaninful enough to include in Unicode", but also "Seems too numerous to leave out". I understand the first, but the second is moot. I'm sure that you will be able to find lots of occurrences of the flat N025A next to the tall N25 (the "foreign land" sign) in encodings, but that doesn't mean that N25 and N025A have independent character identities. If you believe that N025A (U+1320A) was made Legacy for good reasons (and I would agree), then why should U+13F98 and U+13F99 both exist as core signs in Unicode?

"I could not verify any token with an glyph, and for Unicode only F2ED7 (O329A) OR F2EDA (O329) should be added, not both."

    <p>The description of U+13FD6 is not at all what the glyph shows. The glyph has the sky sign where I would expect two abaci (one abacus on top of each column, if I understand what an abacus is). Also, there is not one base, but rather two bases, one under each column.  How I interpret the description of U+13FD6 is as U+13FC1 but without the carrying chair.

The abaci are not shown in the glyph. (Why bother mentioning the abaci in the

    </p>
    <p>The Database says "Needs to be atomic due to the position of the O34."
</p>
    <p>
Nonsense, because (1) whether O34 is 1pt higher or lower relative to the legs is paleography, and (2) it is the font's responsibility to arrange signs in a suitable manner. This exact group was in fact listed in:
</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax/ligaturelist.html">https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax/ligaturelist.html</a>

    </p>
    <p>
If we are starting to encode groups atomically because we wish to fine-tune their exact positioning, then why did we bother with controls in the first place? Controls by definition abstract away from exact positionings. The advantages of controls are normalization and abstraction.  Are we willing to give up on these advantages now?  It makes no sense to on the one hand deprecate clearly distinct graphical variants in the basic list (making them Legacy), motivated by the advantages of normalization and abstraction, while on the other hand introducing new atomic encodings of compositional groups, moving away from normalization.
</p>
    <p>
And if you accept that Unicode needs to encode fine-tuned positioning, then the one or two ligatures that have slipped through in the extended Unicode set will not suffice. You will need to start introducing possibly hundreds of additional code points of compositional groups. I don't think anyone would be happy with that either.

    <p>There is "with an oar/rudder at the back" for U+14068, there is "with lines crossing the prow" for U+1406C, and nothing comparable for U+1406B. Yet the shape looks identical in all three glyphs. For consistency, can we just have "with an oar/rudder at the back/front" for all these cases?

    </p>
    <p>I don't see the "multiple horizontal lines written over it" in the glyph of U+14070. Presumably, what was meant is similar to U+14075.
</p>
    <p>
I also think that the internal lines of the shrine and the lines of the sledge should not have been drawn as one and running over the boat/ship, if I understand the description correctly.

    <p>It is hard to imagine a more blatant, more literal violation of Point 5 of the
Encoding Principles:
</p>
    <p>
"Signs that exist with and without inner detailing will be included with the inner detailing"
</p>
    <p>
Most of the Encoding Principles use weasel words that allow unlimited proliferation of
variant shapes despite giving the impression of wanting to keep the number of
variant shapes within reasonable bounds. If even one of the clearer Encoding Principles
is so flagrantly broken, then what is the point of having the Encoding Principles in the first place?

    <p>The glyph suggests *two* oars/rudders.

I would not call the mentioned shape in the glyph a "horizontal rectangle". A rectangle consists of straight lines, while the shape is prominently curved. Perhaps say "flat shape inside between prow and stern with vertical lines as internal decoration"?

    <p>In U+1410B, U+1410C, U+1410D the mentioned things are connected by a line at the bottom. The line is thin in U+1410C while it is thick and prominent in U+1410B and U+1410D. By all reasonable measures, the thickness should not matter as to the identity of the sign. Even if the line is drawn as in U+1410A, it is still just a line. I doubt there are any good reasons for talking about "base" in U+14109 and U+1410A while not even mentioning the connecting line in U+1410B, U+1410C, U+1410D. 
</p>
    <p>
The description of U+14110 does mention "base", while the glyph has just a thick line, just like U+1410B and U+1410D.
</p>
    <p>
My proposal would be to have "on a base" (not "a rectangular base") for all such signs for consistency.

    </p>
    <p>How is there a sickle shape? To me, U+132EF and U+141AF look identical except that one is slightly wider than the other, which is generally not a good enough reason to introduce multiple code points.
</p>
    <p>
The Encoding Principles have under point 2:
</p>
    <p>
"Chubby or slender signs are part of this continuum and will not be
differentiated."
</p>
    <p>
This seems to suggest that U+141AF should not have existed next to U+132EF.

    <p>A square is a special case of a rectangle; just saying. The fringes are comparably long, drawn slightly differently but so what?
It doesn't seem appropriate to me that such shapes would be distinguished in Unicode (cf. again the Encoding Principles).

    <p>I see no "loop" in U+14214. If a loop is added, then U+14214 and U+14216 become basically the same shape. Not sure how the diagonal part of the standard fits in.

    <p>"At the front" in the description of U+1429D becomes confusing because the sign is mirrored relative to say U+1429C. Elsewhere in descriptions I have seen use of "left" and "right". I realise the downside of left/right is that strictly speaking this becomes incorrect for right-to-left running text, but the left/right terminology tends to be less ambiguous than front/back when describing signs in the sign list.

    <p>In the Unicode 5.2 code charts (not the Unicode 16 code charts), the handle of U+13349 was already a little below the wood.  Either way, distinguishing these two variants on the basis of how many pixels the handle is below the wood is entirely inappropriate for Unicode.

In the Database there is a comment:
</p>
    <p>
"Variation seems meaningless to me. I would not even include it as a class in TSL."
</p>
    <p>
Quite! How this then became a new code point, let alone a core sign, is a mystery to me.

    <p>I suspect the "horizontal line on top of the forked drill-bit" should have distinguished these two, but
it is missing from the glyph of U+142C5. Without this, the signs are identical for all practical purposes.

    <p>The vertical line is interrupted by the base. That seems inconsistent with the description. Is the glyph incorrect or should the description be amended?

    <p>Again, is the vertical line in U+142F7 supposed to be interrupted at the base? There isn't actually a vertical line between the two ovals, it looks more like there is whitespace between the two ovals.

U+142F7 has "upwards dot"? I would not describe the shape in the glyph as a dot. It looks more like U22 (U+1334A).
